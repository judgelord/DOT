PHMSA has reviewed transportation incident data and findings of several National Transportation Safety Board and Chemical Satety Board accident investigations involving bulk hazardous materials loading and unloading operations, which suggest there may be opportunities to enhance the safety of such operations. In particular, PHMSA is examining what, if any, safety benefits would accrue from a requirement for persons conducting bulk loading and unloading operations to develop and implement operating procedures governing these operations.","Information Collection","","","","","","","Prompting action: Secretarial/Head of Operating Administration Decision","Legal Deadline: None",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rulemaking Project Initiated: 10/28/2008","Docket Number: PHMSA-2007-28119",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for ANPRM: None      ","","","","","","","","Federal Register Citation for ANPRM: None"
