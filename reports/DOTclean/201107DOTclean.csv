CSA 2010 is a new operational model FMCSA plans to implement that is designed to help the Agency carry out its compliance and enforcement programs more efficiently and effectively. Currently, the safety fitness rating of a motor carrier is determined based on the results of a very labor intensive compliance review conducted at the carrierå«s place of business. Aside from roadside inspections and new audits, the compliance review is the Agencyå«s primary intervention. Under CSA 2010, FMCSA would propose to implement a broader array of progressive interventions, some of which allow FMCSA to make contact with more carriers. Through this rulemaking FMCSA would establish safety fitness determinations based on safety data consisting of crashes, inspections, and violation history rather than the standard compliance review.

We anticipate that all vehicles would be able to meet them because it would not involve changes to the existing basic requirements of the standard. Second, we are considering adding a new requirement for a brake-throttle override system on light vehicles. Under certain conditions, this would require that the braking system override the throttle control in the event of a conflict. All vehicle manufacturers are in the process of equipping all of their U.S. vehicles with such technology, if they have not done so already.

The National Academy provided Congress and NHTSA with this report on March 18, 2010. EISA then requires that NHTSA complete a study that examines the fuel efficiency of commercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work trucks and determines the appropriate test procedures and methodologies for measuring the fuel efficiency of such vehicles, the appropriate metric for measuring the fuel efficiency of such vehicles, the range of factors that affect the fuel efficiency of these vehicles, and other factors that could impact a program to improve the fuel efficiency of these vehicles. The NHTSA study was issued October 25, 2010. Once that study is completed, NHTSA has 24 months to complete a final rule establishing a fuel efficiency program for these vehicles. The law provides that the new standards must provide at least 4 full model years of regulatory leadtime and 3 full model years of regulatory stability (i.e., the standards must remain in effect for 3 years before they may be amended).
