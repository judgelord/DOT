The standard would incorporate the current 49 CFR Part 563, which established the current reporting requirement of voluntarily installed EDRs in light vehicles. Part 563 presently requires vehicle manufacturers who are voluntarily installing EDRs to be in compliance with the regulation by September 1, 2012. This rulemaking would not affect the 2012 compliance date for voluntarily-installed EDRs. Furthermore, this rulemaking would not modify any of the Part 563 data elements, data capture and format requirements, data retrieval specifications, or data survivability and crash test requirements. Moreover, this rulemaking to mandate EDRs across the entire light vehicle fleet could contribute to advancements in vehicle designs, and advanced restraint and other safety countermeasures. The estimated total incremental costs associated with this rulemaking would be $24.4 million (2009 dollars), which is measured from a baseline of 91.6 percent EDR installation to 100 percent installation, assuming the sale of 15.5 million light vehicles per year.",,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 02/22/2011,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None2,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,201103,Popular Title: EDRs Upgrade,Upgrade of Event Data Recorder Requirements,Green,RIN 2127-AK87,Stage: ANPRM,Previous Stage:None,"Abstract: This rulemaking would expand the utility of the amount and type of data Event Data Recorders (EDRs) capture in light vehicles in the event of a crash. The rulemaking would consider requiring some of the optional data elements specified in 49 CFR Part 563. Part 563 established the current reporting requirement of voluntarily installed EDRs in light vehicles. In addition, this rulemaking would make revisions to the optional data elements to account for the latest advances in vehicle safety. Part 563 presently requires vehicle manufacturers who are voluntarily installing EDRs to be in compliance with the regulation by September 1, 2012. In a separate rulemaking (2127-AK86 Mandatory Part 563 Event Data Recorder Requirements), the agency would propose requiring that all light vehicles comply with the requirements specified in current 49 CFR 563. This rulemaking would seek additional information from the public and expand upon that initiative. Moreover, this rulemaking would contribute to advancements in vehicle designs, advanced restraints and other safety countermeasures.

The DPA is the Presidentå«s primary authority to ensure timely availability of private sector resources for national defense. In addition to military and energy activities, the definition of ""national defense"" includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title   VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the protection and restoration of critical infrastructure. Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorization legislation, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditons. Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practacable, the rules be consistent and unifed.

The final rule established an 18-month program development deadline of August 1, 2011, and a subsequent 18-month program implementation deadline of February   1, 2013. This rulemaking would expedite the program implementation deadline to August 1, 2011, for most of the requirements, except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management, which would have a program implementation deadline of August 1, 2012. The final rule's regulatory analysis did not consider specific costs for the program implementation deadlines, because the costs associated with the rule were determined to be the first-year program implementation costs, and were not dependent on the implementation deadline. PHMSA believes that the 18 months provided for program development is sufficient for pipeline operators to both develop and implement certain provisions of the rule. Where PHMSA believes there is a need for additional program implementation time, the rulemaking would moderately shorten that time by only six months. Therefore, PHMSA does not believe there is additional cost for this rulemaking beyond what has already been evaluated in the original control room management final rule.",,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/05/2010 Docket Number: PHMSA-2007-27954 Dates for Final Rule:,Docket Number: Unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None21,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,201103,Popular Title: Use of Mobile Telephones,Hazardous Materials: Limiting the Use of Mobile Telephones by Highway,Red,RIN 2137-AE65,Stage: NPRM,Previous Stage:None,"Abstract: This rulemaking would limit the use of mobile telephones by drivers during the operation of a motor vehicle containing a quantity of hazardous materials requiring placarding under Part 172 of the 49 CFR or any quantity of a select agent or toxin listed in 42 CFR Part 73.
