However, other three-wheeled vehicles have passenger-car characteristics such as fully enclosed cabins, hinged doors with roll-up windows, steering wheels, and side-by-side seating. Because these car-like vehicles ride on three wheels instead of four, they are not required to meet federal safety standards for passenger cars (although they are subject to motorcycle safety standards.) Various car-like three-wheeled vehicle models have been imported into the U.S. and have been available for sale to the public.

Specifically, this rulemaking would have proposed that persons who offer unrefined petroleum-based products for transportation, regardless of mode of transportation, apply particular methods for conducting vapor pressure testing when vapor pressure testing is a component of their written testing program. However, after a thorough review of the issues, PHMSA decided to terminate this rulemaking action. This action will not appear on next month's report on DOT significant rulemakings.","None ","","","","","","","Prompting action: None","","","","","","","Rulemaking Project Initiated: 10/12/2016","Docket Number: ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None"
