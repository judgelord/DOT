CSA 2010 is a new operational model FMCSA plans to implement that is designed to help the Agency carry out its compliance and enforcement programs more efficiently and effectively. Currently, the safety fitness rating of a motor carrier is determined based on the results of a very labor intensive compliance review conducted at the carrierÇs place of business. Aside from roadside inspections and new audits, the compliance review is the AgencyÇs primary intervention. Under CSA 2010, FMCSA would propose to implement a broader array of progressive interventions, some of which allow FMCSA to make contact with more carriers. Through this rulemaking FMCSA would establish safety fitness determinations based on safety data consisting of crashes, inspections, and violation history rather than the standard compliance review.

Currently, there are over 52,000 annual ejections in motor vehicle crashes, and over 10,000 ejected fatalities per year. This rulemaking would propose new requirements for reducing occupant ejection through passenger vehicle side widows. The requirement would be an occupant containment requirement on the amount of allowable excursion through passenger vehicle side windows. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA-LU) requires that ""[t]he Secretary shall also initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish performance standards to reduce complete and partial ejections of vehicle occupants from outboard seating positions. In formulating the standards the Secretary shall consider various ejection mitigation systems. The Secretary shall issue a final rule under this paragraph no later than October 1, 2009."" SAFETEA-LU also requires that, if the Secretary determines that the subject final rule deadline cannot be met, the Secretary shall notify and provide an explanation to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce of the delay. On September 24, 2009, the Secretary provided appropriate notification to Congress that the final rule will be delayed until January 31, 2011.",Economically Significant Major,Unfunded Mandate EU,NAFTA,Foreign,,,,Prompting action: Statute,Legal Deadline: Final Rule : 10/01/2009 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/10/2005 Docket Number: NHTSA-2009-0183 Dates for Final Rule:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: Unknown,Docket Number: Unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None      ,,,Additional coordination necessary,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None58,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,201010,Popular Title: Rearview Mirrors,"Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 111, Rearview Mirrors",Red,RIN 2127-AK43,Stage: NPRM,Previous Stage: ANPRM: Publication Date 03/04/09; End of Comment Period 05/04/09,"Abstract: This rulemaking would amend Federal Motor Vehicle Standard No. 111; Rearview Mirrors, to reflect requirements contained in the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007.

The statute requires that rulemaking begin with a report by the National Academy of Sciences evaluating medium-duty and heavy-duty truck fuel economy standards. The National Academy provided Congress and NHTSA with this report on March 18, 2010. EISA then requires that NHTSA provide Congress a report that examines the fuel efficiency of commercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work trucks and determines the appropriate test procedures and methodologies for measuring the fuel efficiency of such vehicles, the appropriate metric for measuring the fuel efficiency of such vehicles, the range of factors that affect the fuel efficiency of these vehicles, and other factors that could impact a program to improve the fuel efficiency of these vehicles. Once that report has been delivered to Congress, NHTSA has 24 months to complete a final rule establishing a fuel efficiency program for these vehicles. The law provides that the new standards must provide at least 4 full model years of regulatory leadtime and 3 full model years of regulatory stability (i.e., the standards must remain in effect for 3 years before they may be amended).
