The Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) require shipments stored during transportation to conform to the same requirements that apply when the shipments are actually moving and for the shipping company to have security plans covering its shipments. Otherwise, the HMR do not include specific requirements for facilities at which explosives or other high-hazard materials are stored during transportation. The HMR do not establish specific standards for storage facilities nor do they limit the amount of material that may be stored in a single location. Through this rulemaking, the agency will evaluate the adequacy of existing regulations and the need for additional, more specific requirements. In particular, the agency is considering whether current industry standards applicable to the storage of explosives should be incorporated by reference into the HMR.","None","","","","","","","Prompting action: None","Legal Deadline: None",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/01/2005 Docket Number: PHMSA-2005-22987 Dates for NPRM:","Docket Number: Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ","","","Additional coordination necessary","","","","","Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None"
