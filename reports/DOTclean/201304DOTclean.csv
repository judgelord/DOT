CSA is an operational model FMCSA implemented that is designed to help the Agency carry out its compliance and enforcement programs more efficiently and effectively. Currently, the safety fitness rating of a motor carrier is determined based on the results of a very labor intensive compliance review conducted at the carrier«s place of business. Aside from roadside inspections and new entrant audits, the compliance review is the Agency«s primary intervention. Under CSA, FMCSA would propose to implement a broader array of interventions, some of which allow FMCSA to make contact with more carriers. Through this rulemaking FMCSA would establish safety fitness determinations based on safety data from crashes, inspections, investigations, and violation history rather than just the standard compliance review.

This action will ensure that FMCSA, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and our State partners are able to identify motor carriers transporting passengers in interstate commerce and correctly assign responsibility for regulatory violations during inspections, compliance investigations, and crash studies. It also provides the general public with the means to identify the responsible motor carrier at the time of transportation.

Rollover and loss of control crashes involving heavy vehicles is a serious safety issue that is responsible for 304 fatalities and 2,738 injuries annually. They are also a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions of dollars of lost productivity and excess energy consumption each year. Suppliers and truck and motorcoach manufacturers have developed stability control technology for heavy vehicles to mitigate these types of crashes. Our preliminary estimate produces an effectiveness range of thirty-seven to fifty-six percent against single-vehicle tractor-trailer rollover crashes and three to fourteen percent against loss of control crashes that result from skidding on the road surface. With these effectiveness estimates, annually, we estimate 29 - 66 lives would be saved, 517 - 979 MAIS 1-5 injuries would be reduced, and 810 - 1,693 crashes that involved property damage only would be eliminated. Additionally, it would save $10 - $26 million in property damage and travel delays. Based on the technology unit costs and affected vehicles, we estimate technology costs would be $55 to 107 million, annually. However, the costs savings from reducing travel delay and property damage would produce net benefits of $128 - $372 million.

Under the existing regulatory definition of motorcycle in Part 571.3, three-wheeled motor vehicles are classified as motorcycles. This is appropriate for motorcycles with sidecars, trikes, and other three-wheeled vehicles that are based on a motorcycle-like configuration. However, other three-wheeled vehicles have passenger-car characteristics such as fully enclosed cabins, hinged doors with roll-up windows, steering wheels, and side-by-side seating. Because these car-like vehicles ride on three wheels instead of four, they are not required to meet federal safety standards for passenger cars (although they are subject to motorcycle safety standards.) Various car-like three-wheeled vehicle models have been imported into the U.S. and have been available for sale to the public. NHTSA believes consumers who purchase these vehicles are likely to assume that these vehicles have the same safety features and crash protection as passenger cars certified to federal safety standards.","None ","","","","","","","Prompting action: None","","","","","","","Rulemaking Project Initiated: 02/10/2012","Docket Number: ","10/04/2012Ê","04/28/2013Ê","","","","","","","","","","","11/22/2012Ê","05/26/2013Ê","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","02/21/2013Ê","08/25/2013Ê","","","","","02/26/2013Ê","08/30/2013Ê","","04/27/2013Ê","10/30/2013Ê","","","","","","","","Additional coordination necessary","","","","","","","","Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None"
