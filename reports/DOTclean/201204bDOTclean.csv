The DPA is the Presidentå«s primary authority to ensure timely availability of private sector resources for national defense. In addition to military and energy activities, the definition of ""national defense"" includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title   VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the protection and restoration of critical infrastructure. Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorization legislation, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditions. Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practicable, the rules be consistent and unified. DOT is part of an interagency working group, along with the other delegated agencies, that is developing consistent unified rules.",Information Collection,,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,Legal Deadline: Final rule : 06/27/2010 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/07/2009 Docket Number:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: Unknown,Docket Number: Unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None5,Office of the Secretary,201204,Popular Title: Seat-Strapping,Use of the Seat-Strapping Method for Carrying a Wheelchair on an Aircraft,Yellow,RIN 2105-AD87,Stage: Final Rule,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 06/03/2011; End of Comment Period 08/02/2011.,Abstract: This rulemaking would address whether carriers should be allowed to utilize the seat-strapping method to stow a passengerå«s wheelchair in the aircraft cabin.,Regulatory Flexibility Act,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 04/30/2009,Docket Number: Dates for Final Rule:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None6,Office of the Secretary,201204,Popular Title: Stowage and Assistive Devices,"Stowage of Wheelchairs, other Mobility Aids and other Assistive Devices",Red,RIN 2105-AD90,Stage: Undetermined,Previous Stage:None,"Abstract: This rulemaking would amend 14 CFR Part 382 (Part 382) by including Subpart I (14 CFR 382.121-382.133) in the list of subparts with which a U.S. carrier must comply with respect to passengers traveling under its code on flights operated by a foreign carrier between two foreign points.
