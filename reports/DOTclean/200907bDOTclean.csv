It would require operators to develop, implement, and submit to PHMSA (or the appropriate State), a human factors management plan designed to reduce risks associated with human factors. This would require operators to include in their plans a maximum limit on the hours of service for individuals employed as controllers. It would also require operators to periodically review their management of computer-based control system alarms and to verify that the control systems provide accurate and timely information to controllers.

For small businesses, the registration fee would remain at its current level of $975 (plus a $25 administrative fee). The increase is necessary to fund the national Hazardous Material Emergency Preparedness (HMEP) grants program at its authorized level of $28,000,000.
