The DPA is the President«s primary authority to ensure timely availability of private sector resources for national defense. In addition to military and energy activities, the definition of ""national defense"" includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title   VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the protection and restoration of critical infrastructure. Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorization legislation, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditons. Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practacable, the rules be consistent and unifed. DOT is part of an interageny working group, along with the other delegated agencies, that is developing consistent unifed rules.","Information Collection","","","","","","","Prompting action: Statute","Legal Deadline: Final rule : 06/27/2010 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/07/2009 Docket Number:",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rulemaking Project Initiated: Unknown","Docket Number: Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ","","","Additional coordination necessary","","","","","Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None"
