It would require operators to develop, implement, and submit to PHMSA (or the appropriate State), a human factors management plan designed to reduce risks associated with human factors. This would require operators to include in their plans a maximum limit on the hours of service for individuals employed as controllers. It would also require operators to periodically review their management of computer-based control system alarms and to verify that the control systems provide accurate and timely information to controllers.
