Supplemental Notice of Intent: Publication Date 12/08/2010. Supplemental Notice of Intent: Signed by DOT Secretary and EPA Administrator 7/29/2011.,"Abstract: This rulemaking established Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for light trucks and passenger cars for model years 2017 through 2021 and set augural standards for model year 2022 through 2025 vehicles. This rulemaking responds to requirements of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The statute requires that CAFE standards be prescribed separately for passenger automobiles and non-passenger automobiles to achieve a combined fleet fuel economy of at least 35 mpg by model year 2020. For model years 2021 and beyond, the statute requires that the average fuel economy required to be attained by each fleet of passenger and non-passenger automobiles be the maximum feasible for each model year. The law requires the standards be set at least 18 months prior to the start of the model year. On May 21, 2010, President Obama issued a memorandum directing NHTSA and EPA to conduct a joint rulemaking (NHTSA regulating fuel economy and EPA regulating greenhouse gas emissions), and to issue a Notice of Intent to Issue a Proposed Rule (NOI) by September 30, 2010. NHTSA completed this objective, subsequently issuing  a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in November, 2011, and a Final Rule on August 28, 2012. The estimated total incremental cost for this program is $154B (2010 dollars), incremental benefits $630B (3% discount rate) and $503B (7% discount rate), and incremental net benefits $476B (3% discount rate) and $356B (7% discount rate).",Economically Significant,Major,EIS EU,NAFTA,Foreign,,,Prompting action: Statute,Legal Deadline: Final Rule : 04/01/2015 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 05/27/2010 Docket Number: NHTSA-2010-0131 Dates for Final Rule:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: Unknown,Docket Number: Unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None61,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,201209,Popular Title: * Mandatory EDR Requirements,Mandatory Event Data Recorder Requirements (RRR),Yellow,RIN 2127-AK86,Stage: NPRM,Previous Stage:None,"Abstract: This rulemaking would establish a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard to mandate the installation of Event Data Recorders (EDR) in light vehicles. The standard would incorporate the current 49 CFR Part 563, which established the current reporting requirement of voluntarily installed EDRs in light vehicles. Part 563 presently requires vehicle manufacturers who are voluntarily installing EDRs to be in compliance with the regulation by September 1, 2012. This rulemaking would not affect the 2012 compliance date for voluntarily-installed EDRs. Furthermore, this rulemaking would not modify any of the Part 563 data elements, data capture and format requirements, data retrieval specifications, or data survivability and crash test requirements. Moreover, this rulemaking to mandate EDRs across the entire light vehicle fleet could contribute to advancements in vehicle designs, and advanced restraint and other safety countermeasures.

In addition, this rulemaking would make revisions to the optional data elements to account for the latest advances in vehicle safety. Part 563 presently requires vehicle manufacturers who are voluntarily installing EDRs to be in compliance with the regulation by September 1, 2012. In a separate rulemaking (2127-AK86 Mandatory Part 563 Event Data Recorder Requirements), the agency would propose requiring that all light vehicles comply with the requirements specified in current 49 CFR 563. This rulemaking would seek additional information from the public and expand upon that initiative. Moreover, this rulemaking would contribute to advancements in vehicle designs, advanced restraints and other safety countermeasures.

We believe this rule would have minimal cost, as all heavy trucks already have these devices installed, although some vehicles do not have the limit set.
