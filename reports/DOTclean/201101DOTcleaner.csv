"109","Abstract: This rulemaking would require design approval holders to establish limits of validity (LOVs) of the engineering data that support the maintenance programs for certain transport category airplanes, and it would require them to determine if maintenance actions are needed to prevent widespread fatigue damage before an airplane reaches its LOV. This rulemaking would require operators of any affected airplane to incorporate the LOV into the airworthiness limitations section of the instructions for continued airworthiness. This rulemaking would also prohibit operation of an affected airplane beyond the LOV, unless an operator has incorporated an extended LOV and any necessary service information into its maintenance program.","","","",6

"133","Abstract: This rulemaking would establish a rule to allow passenger-carrying commuter operations to be conducted under the provisions of part 135 using multiengine turbojets, certificated under either part 23 or part 25, configured with 9 or fewer passenger seats. The rulemaking would allow multiengine turbojet operators to provide commuter service to the traveling public, thus accommodating new techonologies and a new generation of turbojet airplanes that otherwise would not be allowed in part 135 commuter service. Since 1995, turbojets used in scheduled operations must operate under the provisions of part 121. This current rulemaking resulted, in part, from recommendations from the Aviation Rulemaking Committee for parts 14 CFR 135/125 and covers pilot crew, equipment, training, and dispatch requirements for the safe operation of this new generation airplane. An earlier internet report listed this item as an NPRM with a scheduled publication date of 10/20/09. FAA has decided to terminate this rulemaking.","","","",6

"688","Abstract: This rulemaking would change FMCSA regulations to govern applications by Mexican carriers to operate beyond municipalities and commercial zones at the United State- Mexico border. It would also revise the application form, OP-1MX, to be filed by these Mexican motor carriers. The revised form would require additional information about the applicantå«s business and operating practices to allow the FMCSA to determine if the applicant can meet the safety standards established for operating in interstate commerce in the United States. Carriers that had previously submitted an application would have to  submit the updated form. These changes are needed to implement part of the North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On January 16, 2003, the Ninth Circuit Court remanded this rule, along with two other NAFTA-related rules, to the agency, requiring a  full environmental impact statement and an analysis required by the Clean Air Act. On June 7, 2004, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit and remanded the case, holding that FMCSA is not required to prepare the environmental documents as ruled by the Ninth Circuit. FMCSA originally planned to publish a final rule by November 20, 2003. FMCSA will determine the next steps to be taken after enactment of any pending legislation authorizing cross border trucking.","","","",6

"713","Abstract: This rule would implement a safety monitoring system and compliance initiative designed to evaluate the continuing safety fitness of all Mexico-domiciled carriers within 18 months after receiving a provisional Certificate of Registration or provisional authority to operate in the United States.

The interim rule included requirements that were not proposed in the NPRM but which are necessary to comply with the FY-2002 DOT Appropriations Act.

"756","Abstract: This rulemaking would prohibit States from issuing, renewing, transferring or upgrading a commercial driverå«s license (CDL) with a hazardous materials endorsement, unless the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has first conducted a background check on the applicant and determined the applicant does not pose a security risk warranting denial of the hazardous materials endorsement. FMCSA and TSA simultaneously published interim final rules. FMCSA has published another IFR corresponding to TSAå«s extension of compliance date. Since this rulemaking conforms to TSAå«s rulemaking, the rulemaking is dependent upon TSA action. This action is considered significant because of substantial public and congressional interest, and national security.","","","",6

"889","Abstract: This rulemaking would revise 49 CFR Part 385, Safety Fitness Procedures, in accordance with the Agencyå«s major new initiative, Comprehensive Safety Analysis (CSA) 2010. CSA 2010 is a new operational model FMCSA plans to implement that is designed to help the Agency carry out its compliance and enforcement programs more efficiently and effectively. Currently, the safety fitness rating of a motor carrier is determined based on the results of a very labor intensive compliance review conducted at the carrierå«s place of business. Aside from roadside inspections and new audits, the compliance review is the Agencyå«s primary intervention. Under CSA 2010, FMCSA would propose to implement a broader array of progressive interventions, some of which allow FMCSA to make contact with more carriers. Through this rulemaking FMCSA would establish safety fitness determinations based on safety data consisting of crashes, inspections, and violation history rather than the standard compliance review. This will enable the Agency to assess the safety performance of a greater segment of the motor carrier industry with the goal of further reducing large truck and bus crashes and fatalities.","","","",6

"935","Abstract: This rulemaking would create a central database for verified positive controlled substances and alcohol test results for commercial driverå«s license (CDL) holders and refusals by such drivers to submit to testing. This rulemaking would require employers of CDL holders and service agents to report positive test results and refusals to test into the database. Prospective employers, acting on an application for a CDL driver position with the applicant‰Ûªs written consent to access the database, would query the database to determine if any specific information about the driver applicant is in the database before allowing the applicant to be hired and to drive CMVs. This rulemaking is intended to increase highway safety by ensuring CDL holders, who have tested positive or have refused to submit to testing, have completed the U.S. DOTå«s return-to-duty process before driving CMVs in interstate or intrastate commerce. It is also intended to ensure that employers are meeting  their drug and alcohol testing responsibilities.","","","",6

"958","Abstract: This rulemaking will consider revisions to RIN 2126-AA89 (Electronic On-Board Recorders for Hours of Service Drivers) to expand the number of motor carriers required to install and operate Electronic On-Board Recorders (EOBRs). FMCSA is consolidating this follow-up to the EOBR rule with the Hours Of Service Of Drivers: Supporting Documents rulemaking for development of a single NPRM in RIN 2126-AB20. In addressing Hours of Service Supporting Documents requirements in this new rulemaking, FMCSA will consider reducing or eliminating current paperwork burdens associated with supporting documents in favor of expanded EOBR use. On January 15, 2010, the American Trucking Associations (ATA) filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir. No. 10-1009). ATA petitioned the court to direct FMCSA to issue an NPRM on supporting documents in conformance with the requirements set forth in section 113 of the HMTAA within 60 days after the issuance of the writ and a final rule no later than 6 months after the issuance of the NPRM. The court granted the petition for writ of mandamus on September 30, 2010, ordering FMCSA to issue an NPRM on the supporting document regulations by December 30, 2010.","","","",6

It would revise both the safety limits for these operations and the process to qualify them. It accounts for a range of vehicle types that are currently used and may likely be used on future high-speed or high cant deficiency rail operations, and would provide safety assurance for train operations in all classes of track. It is based on the results of simulation studies designed to identify track geometry irregularities associated with unsafe wheel forces and acceleration, thorough reviews of vehicle qualification and revenue service test data, and consideration of international practices.

It would also contain medical standards for the  assessment of certain conditions that pose a risk of sudden incapacitation (specifically,  stroke, syncope, seizures, cardiovascular disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea). These standards, which are being developed by a physicians task force, would be applied by railroad physicians in required triennial and discretionary interim medical assessments of engineers and conductors.","","","",6

"1368","Abstract: This rulemaking would create a new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) for reducing occupant ejection. Currently, there are over 52,000 annual ejections in motor vehicle crashes, and over 10,000 ejected fatalities per year. This rulemaking would propose new requirements for reducing occupant ejection through passenger vehicle side widows. The requirement would be an occupant containment requirement on the amount of allowable excursion through passenger vehicle side windows. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA-LU) requires that ""[t]he Secretary shall also initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish performance standards to reduce complete and partial ejections of vehicle occupants from outboard seating positions. In formulating the standards the Secretary shall consider various ejection mitigation systems. The Secretary shall issue a final rule under this paragraph no later than October 1, 2009."" SAFETEA-LU also requires that, if the Secretary determines that the subject final rule deadline cannot be met, the Secretary shall notify and provide an explanation to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce of the delay. On September 24, 2009, the Secretary provided appropriate notification to Congress that the final rule will be delayed until January 31, 2011.","","","",6

"1391","Abstract: This rulemaking would amend Federal Motor Vehicle Standard No. 111; Rearview Mirrors, to reflect requirements contained in the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007. The Act requires that NHTSA expand the required field of view to enable the driver of a motor vehicle to detect areas behind the motor vehicle to reduce death and injury resulting from backing incidents, particularly incidents involving small children and disabled persons. According to the Act, such a standard may be met by the provision of additional mirrors, sensors, cameras, or other technology to expand the driverå«s field of view.","","","",6

"1479","Abstract: This rulemaking would respond to requirements of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The statute requires that rulemaking begin with a report by the National Academy of Sciences evaluating medium-duty and heavy-duty truck fuel economy standards. The National Academy provided Congress and NHTSA with this report on March 18, 2010. EISA then requires that NHTSA complete a study that examines the fuel efficiency of commercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work trucks and determines the appropriate test procedures and methodologies for measuring the fuel efficiency of such vehicles, the appropriate metric for measuring the fuel efficiency of such vehicles, the range of factors that affect the fuel efficiency of these vehicles, and other factors that could impact a program to improve the fuel efficiency of these vehicles. The NHTSA study was issued October 25, 2010. Once that study is completed, NHTSA has 24 months to complete a final rule establishing a fuel efficiency program for these vehicles. The law provides that the new standards must provide at least 4 full model years of regulatory leadtime and 3 full model years of regulatory stability (i.e., the standards must remain in effect for 3 years before they may be amended). On May 21, 2010, President Obama issued a memorandum directing NHTSA and EPA conduct a joint rulemaking (NHTSA regulating fuel efficiency and EPA regulating greenhouse gas emissions), and to issue a final rule by July 30, 2011.","","","",6

EISA directs the Secretary of Transportation to label vehicles with a permanent and prominent display that an automobile is capable of operating on alternative fuels, and to include in the ownerå«s manual for vehicles capable of operating on alternative fuels information that describes that capability and the benefits of using alternative fuels, including the renewable nature and environmental benefits of using alternative fuels. Additionally, EISA requires a label to be attached to the fuel compartment of vehicles capable of operating on alternative fuels, with the form of alternative fuel stated on the label. EISA, signed into Law on December 19, 2007, requires that the Secretary issue a final rule not later than 42 months after the date of the enactment.","","","",6

"1549","Abstract: This rulemaking would establish Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for light trucks and passenger cars for model years 2017 and beyond. This rulemaking would respond to requirements of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The statute requires that CAFE standards be prescribed separately for passenger automobiles and non-passenger automobiles to achieve a combined fleet fuel economy of at least 35 mpg by model year 2020. For model years 2021 and beyond, the statute requires that the average fuel economy required to be attained by each fleet of passenger and non-passenger automobiles be the maximum feasible for each model year. The law requires the standards be set at least 18 months prior to the start of the model year.
