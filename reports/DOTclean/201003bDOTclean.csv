In the 2009 DPA reauthorizition, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditons. Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practacable, the rules be consistent and unifed. DOT is part of an interageny working group, along with the other delegated agencies, that is developing consistent unifed rules.",Information Collection,,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,Legal Deadline: Final rule : 06/27/2010 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/07/2009 Docket Number:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: Unknown,Docket Number: Unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ,,,Additional coordination necessary,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None21,Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections - Part 2,201003,Popular Title: Aviation Consumer Part 2,Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections - Part 2,Green,RIN 2105-AD92,Stage: NPRM,Previous Stage:None,Abstract: This rulemaking would enhance airline passenger protections by addressing the following areas:(1) contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays; (2) reporting of tarmac delay data; (3) customer service plans; (4) notification to passengers of flight status changes; (5) inflation adjustment for denied boarding compensation; (6) alternative transportation for passengers on canceled flights; (7) opt-out provisions (e.g. travel insurance); (8) contract of carriage provisions; (9) baggage fees disclosure; and (10) full fare advertising.,Regulatory Flexibility Act,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 07/01/2008,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None22,"Carrier-Supplied Medical Oxygen, Service Animals, and Accessibility of Carrier Websites, Kiosks, and In-Flight Entertainment Systems",201003,Popular Title: ACAA SNPRM,"Carrier-Supplied Medical Oxygen, Service Animals, and Accessibility of Carrier Websites, Kiosks, and In-Flight Entertainment Systems",Green,RIN 2105-AD96,Stage: SNPRM,Previous Stage:None,Abstract: This rulemaking would fulfill a commitment made in the final rule amending the Air Carrier Access Act rules to develop an SNPRM seeking information from the public on: (1) the cost and technical issues involved in requiring carrier website accessibility; (2) whether automated kiosks operated by carriers in airports and elsewhere should be required to be accessible; (3) whether there are safety-related reasons for excluding service animals other than dogs that may be specific to foreign carriers; (4) whether the cost of requiring carriers to supply free in-flight medical oxygen would create an undue burden; and (5) whether providing high-contrast captioning on in-flight entertainment displays is technically and economically feasible.,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 09/15/2009,Docket Number: Dates for SNPRM:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for SNPRM: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for SNPRM: None23,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,201003,Popular Title: Storage of Explosives,Hazardous Materials: Requirements for Storage of Explosives During Transportation,Red,RIN 2137-AE06,Stage: NPRM,Previous Stage: ANPRM: Publication Date 11/16/2005; End of Comment Period 02/14/2006; Reopening of Comment Period 7/03/2008; End of Reopened Comment Period 10/01/2008.,"Abstract: This rulemaking would address the current safety and security risks associated with the storage of explosives during transportation. The Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) require shipments stored during transportation to conform to the same requirements that apply when the shipments are actually moving and for the shipping company to have security plans covering its shipments. Otherwise, the HMR do not include   specific requirements for facilities at which explosives or other high-hazard materials are stored during transportation. The HMR do not establish specific standards for storage facilities nor do they limit the amount of material that may be stored in a single location. Through this rulemaking, the agency will evaluate the adequacy of existing regulations and the need for additional, more specific requirements. In particular, the agency is considering whether current industry standards applicable to the storage of explosives should be incorporated by reference into the HMR.",,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/01/2005,Docket Number: PHMSA-2005-22987,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ,,,Additional coordination necessary,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None24,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,201003,Popular Title: Package Inspection Authority,Hazardous Materials: Enforcement Regulations,Red,RIN 2137-AE13,Stage: Final Rule,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 10/02/2008;End of Comment Period 12/01/2008.,"Abstract: Pursuant to a mandate in SAFETEA-LU (section 7118 of P.L. 109-59), this rulemaking would establish procedural regulations to implement authority provided to DOT to open packages believed to contain hazardous materials; remove such packages from transportation; gather information; order the package transported to a facility for examination and analysis; obtain assistance from qualified persons; and issue emergency restrictions, prohibitions, recalls, or out-of-service orders to abate an imminent hazard.",EU NAFTA,Foreign,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,Legal Deadline: Temporary Rule : 10/11/2005,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Final Rule : 08/10/2006 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/10/2005 Docket Number: PHMSA-2005-22356,Docket Number: Unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None      ,,,Additional coordination necessary,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None25,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,201003,Popular Title: Security Plans,Hazardous Materials: Risk-Based Adjustment of Transportation Security Plan Requirements,Red,RIN 2137-AE22,Stage: Final Rule,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 9/8/2008; End of Comment Period 11/10/2008.,"Abstract: In response to two industry petitions for rulemaking, this rulemaking will reconsider and refine the list of hazardous materials for which security plans are currently required.
