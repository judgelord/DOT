Section 3011 of SAFETEA-LU made a number of changes to 49 U.S.C. 5309 (""Section 5309""), which authorizes the Federal Transit Administration«s (FTA«s) capital investment grant program. SAFETEA-LU emphasized the need to improve the accuracy of the estimates of ridership and costs used to support the selection of a major capital investment (""New Start"") as a locally preferred alternative (LPA) for Section 5309 funds. Federal transit law supports the use of incentives to encourage the development of more reliable cost and ridership estimates for New Starts funded under Section 5309. A number of provisions in Section 5309 recognize that contractors to grant recipients play an important role in increasing the reliability of forecasting methods to estimate costs and utilization of New Starts projects. This rulemaking would establish a new part 612 in the Code of Federal Regulations. It would encourage accurate cost and ridership estimates through the award of additional New Starts funds to project sponsors, which they can choose to pass along to their contractors. FTA is considering the effect of recently-enacted statutory language concerning the issuance of final rules under 49 U.S.C. 5309 on this rulemaking.","","","","","","","","Prompting action: Secretarial/Head of Operating Administration Decision","Legal Deadline: None",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rulemaking Project Initiated: 07/17/2007","Docket Number: FTA-2008-0005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ","","","","","","","","Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None"

The incentive allows manufacturers to calculate a higher average fuel economy level for dual-fueled vehicles, as defined at 49 USC section 32901(a)(8), permitting up to a 0.9 mpg increase in their overall corporate average fuel economy (CAFE). NHTSA is required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to either extend the incentive or explain to Congress why it has not done so by December 31, 2007. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), which was signed by the President on December 19, 2007, extended the CAFE credit provision of AMFA and eventually phases it out, making this action moot.
