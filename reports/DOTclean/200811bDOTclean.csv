Section 3011 of SAFETEA-LU made a number of changes to 49 U.S.C. 5309 (""Section 5309""), which authorizes the Federal Transit Administration«s (FTA«s) capital investment grant program. SAFETEA-LU emphasized the need to improve the accuracy of the estimates of ridership and costs used to support the selection of a major capital investment (""New Start"") as a locally preferred alternative (LPA) for Section 5309 funds. Federal transit law supports the use of incentives to encourage the development of more reliable cost and ridership estimates for New Starts funded under Section 5309. A number of provisions in Section 5309 recognize that contractors to grant recipients play an important role in increasing the reliability of forecasting methods to estimate costs and utilization of New Starts projects. This rulemaking would establish a new part 612 in the Code of Federal Regulations. It would encourage accurate cost and ridership estimates through the award of additional New Starts funds to project sponsors, which they can choose to pass along to their contractors. FTA is considering the effect of recently-enacted statutory language concerning the issuance of final rules under 49 U.S.C. 5309 on this rulemaking.",None,,,,,,,Prompting action: Secretarial/Head of Operating Administration Decision,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 07/17/2007,Docket Number: FTA-2008-0005,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for Undetermined: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Undetermined: None2,Maritime Administration,200811,Popular Title: Cargo Preference NPRM,"Regulations To Be Followed by All Departments, Agencies and Shippers Having Responsibility To Provide a Preference for U.S.-Flag Vessels in the Shipment of Cargoes on Ocean Vessels.",Red,RIN 2133-AB74,Stage: Undetermined,Previous Stage: : Publication Approved ;Publication Date ;End of Comment Period .,Abstract: This rulemaking would revise and clarify the Cargo Preference rules that have not been revised substantially since 1971.
