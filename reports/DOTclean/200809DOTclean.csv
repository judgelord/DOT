CSA 2010 is a new operational model FMCSA plans to implement that is designed to help the Agency carry out its compliance and enforcement programs more efficiently and effectively. Currently, the safety fitness rating of a motor carrier is determined based on the results of a very labor intensive compliance review conducted at the carrier«s place of business. Aside from roadside inspections and new audits, the compliance review is the Agency«s primary intervention. Under CSA 2010, FMCSA would propose to implement a broader array of progressive interventions, some of which allow FMCSA to make contact with more carriers. Through this rulemaking FMCSA would establish safety fitness determinations based on safety data consisting of crashes, inspections, and violation history rather than the standard compliance review.

Section 3011 of SAFETEA-LU made a number of changes to 49 U.S.C. 5309 (""Section 5309""), which authorizes the Federal Transit Administration«s (FTA«s) capital investment grant program. SAFETEA-LU emphasized the need to improve the accuracy of the estimates of ridership and costs used to support the selection of a major capital investment (""New Start"") as a locally preferred alternative (LPA) for Section 5309 funds. Federal transit law supports the use of incentives to encourage the development of more reliable cost and ridership estimates for New Starts funded under Section 5309. A number of provisions in Section 5309 recognize that contractors to grant recipients play an important role in increasing the reliability of forecasting methods to estimate costs and utilization of New Starts projects. This rulemaking would establish a new part 612 in the Code of Federal Regulations. It would encourage accurate cost and ridership estimates through the award of additional New Starts funds to project sponsors, which they can choose to pass along to their contractors.
