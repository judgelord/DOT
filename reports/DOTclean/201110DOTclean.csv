FMCSA is consolidating this follow-up to the EOBR rule with the Hours Of Service Of Drivers: Supporting Documents rulemaking for development of a single NPRM in RIN 2126-AB20. In addressing Hours of Service Supporting Documents requirements in this new rulemaking, FMCSA will consider reducing or eliminating current paperwork burdens associated with supporting documents in favor of expanded EOBR use. On January 15, 2010, the American Trucking Associations (ATA) filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir. No. 10-1009). ATA petitioned the court to direct FMCSA to issue an NPRM on supporting documents in conformance with the requirements set forth in section 113 of the HMTAA within 60 days after the issuance of the writ and a final rule no later than 6 months after the issuance of the NPRM. The court granted the petition for writ of mandamus on September 30, 2010, ordering FMCSA to issue an NPRM on the supporting document regulations by December 30, 2010. At the request of the agency, the DC Circuit extended the deadline to January 31, 2011. On April 5, 2010, FMCSA issued a final rule (RIN 2126-AA89) that required the use of EOBRs by motor carriers with significant hours-of-service violations (75 FR 17208). A petition for judicial review was made with the Seventh Circuit. On August 26, 2011, the Court vacated the final rule, which removed the technical specifications used in this rulemaking. The Agency is currently evaluating alternatives in continuing this rulemaking, and at this time is uncertain of the rule‰Ûªs schedule.",Economically Significant Major,Unfunded Mandate Regulatory Flexibility Act Information Collection Privacy,,,,,,Prompting action: Court Action,Legal Deadline: NPRM : 01/31/2011 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/26/1994 Docket Number:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: Unknown,Docket Number: Unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for Undetermined: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Undetermined: None39,Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,201110,Popular Title: HOS (Settlement Agreement),Hours of Service,Green,RIN 2126-AB26,Stage: Final Rule,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 12/29/10; End of Comment Period 03/04/11; End of Reopened Comment Period 06/08/11,"Abstract: This rulemaking would propose changes to the hours of service requirements for drivers operating a commercial motor vehicle transporting property.

First, we are considering revisions to the test procedures for vehicles with electronically controlled throttles as well as electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles. These test procedures are the product of several workshops and public meetings. We anticipate that all vehicles would be able to meet them because it would not involve changes to the existing basic requirements of the standard. Second, we are considering adding a new requirement for a brake-throttle override system on light vehicles. Under certain conditions, this would require that the braking system override the throttle control in the event of a conflict. All vehicle manufacturers are in the process of equipping all of their U.S. vehicles with such technology, if they have not done so already.

The statute requires that rulemaking begin with a report by the National Academy of Sciences evaluating medium-duty and heavy-duty truck fuel economy standards. The National Academy provided Congress and NHTSA with this report on March 18, 2010. EISA then requires that NHTSA complete a study that examines the fuel efficiency of commercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work trucks and determines the appropriate test procedures and methodologies for measuring the fuel efficiency of such vehicles, the appropriate metric for measuring the fuel efficiency of such vehicles, the range of factors that affect the fuel efficiency of these vehicles, and other factors that could impact a program to improve the fuel efficiency of these vehicles. The NHTSA study was issued October 25, 2010. Once that study is completed, NHTSA has 24 months to complete a final rule establishing a fuel efficiency program for these vehicles. The law provides that the new standards must provide at least 4 full model years of regulatory leadtime and 3 full model years of regulatory stability (i.e., the standards must remain in effect for 3 years before they may be amended). On May 21, 2010, President Obama issued a memorandum directing NHTSA and EPA conduct a joint rulemaking (NHTSA regulating fuel efficiency and EPA regulating greenhouse gas emissions), and to issue a final rule by July 30, 2011.",Economically Significant Major,Unfunded Mandate,EIS EU,NAFTA,Foreign,,,Prompting action: Statute,Legal Deadline: NHTSA Study : 09/30/2010 Final rule : 09/28/2012 Publish Final Rule per Presidential Memo : 07/30/2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 12/19/2007 ,Docket Number: NHTSA-2010-0079,6/2/11,6/17/11,5/30/11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6/26/11,6/26/11,6/30/11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7/25/11,7/25/11,8/8/11,NA,NA,NA,7/29/11,7/29/11,9/15/11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary ,,,Additional coordination necessary,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: 76 FR 5710666,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,201110,Popular Title: Alternative Fuel Usage Labeling & Badging,Alternative Fuel Vehicle Badging and Fuel Compartment Labels on Alternative Fuel Usage,Red,RIN 2127-AK75,Stage: Undetermined,Previous Stage:None,"Abstract: This rulemaking would respond to requirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), Title 1, Subtitle A, Section 105, as it amends 49 USC å_ 32908, to implement Consumer Information and Consumer Education programs related to fuel economy, GHG, other emissions, and alternative fuels.
