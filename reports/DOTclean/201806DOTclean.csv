Under the existing regulatory definition of motorcycle in Part 571.3, three-wheeled motor vehicles are classified as motorcycles. This is appropriate for motorcycles with sidecars, trikes, and other three-wheeled vehicles that are based on a motorcycle-like configuration. However, other three-wheeled vehicles have passenger-car characteristics such as fully enclosed cabins, hinged doors with roll-up windows, steering wheels, and side-by-side seating. Because these car-like vehicles ride on three wheels instead of four, they are not required to meet federal safety standards for passenger cars (although they are subject to motorcycle safety standards.) Various car-like three-wheeled vehicle models have been imported into the U.S. and have been available for sale to the public. NHTSA believes consumers who purchase these vehicles are likely to assume that these vehicles have the same safety features and crash protection as passenger cars certified to federal safety standards.","Effects:","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Originally","New","Actual","Scheduled","Projected","Date","Date","Date","","","","","","","","","","","","","Resubmitted to OST/3"

Operators have suggested that performing integrity management measures on pipelines where class locations have changed due to population increases would be an equally safe but less costly alternative to the current requirements of either reducing pressure, pressure testing, or replacing pipe. This request for public comment would be used to inform future regulatory or deregulatory efforts related to this topic.","Effects:","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Originally","New","Actual","Scheduled","Projected","Date","Date","Date","","11/06/2017Ê","","01/30/2018Ê","","","","12/26/2017Ê","","","","","Resubmitted to OST/3"

Currently, the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) do not contain the necessary provisions to allow for the bulk transport of LNG in rail tank cars. PHMSA, in collaboration with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), believe this is a potential area for industry innovation and support infrastructure development while maintaining a high level of safety. This rulemaking intends to develop a framework for the safe transport of LNG in rail tank cars.","Effects:","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Originally","New","Actual","Scheduled","Projected","Date","Date","Date","","10/03/2018Ê","","","","","","11/16/2018Ê","","","","","Resubmitted to OST/3"
