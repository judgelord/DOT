Under the existing regulatory definition of motorcycle in Part 571.3, three-wheeled motor vehicles are classified as motorcycles. This is appropriate for motorcycles with sidecars, trikes, and other three- wheeled vehicles that are based on a motorcycle-like configuration. However, other three- wheeled vehicles have passenger-car characteristics such as fully enclosed cabins, hinged doors with roll-up windows, steering wheels, and side-by-side seating. Because these car- like vehicles ride on three wheels instead of four, they are not required to meet federal safety standards for passenger cars (although they are subject to motorcycle safety standards.) Various car-like three-wheeled vehicle models have been imported into the U.S. and have been available for sale to the public. NHTSA believes consumers who purchase these vehicles are likely to assume that these vehicles have the same safety features and crash protection as passenger cars certified to federal safety standards.","","","","","","","","Prompting action: None","Legal Deadline: None",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rulemaking Project Initiated: 02/10/2012","Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ","","","","","","","","Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None"

The DPA is the Presidentå«s primary authority to ensure timely availability of private sector resources for national defense. In addition to military and energy activities, the definition of ""national defense"" includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title   VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the protection and restoration of critical infrastructure. Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorization legislation, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditions. Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practicable, the rules be consistent and unified. DOT is part of an interagency working group, along with the other delegated agencies, that is developing consistent unified rules.","Information Collection","","","","","","","Prompting action: Statute","Legal Deadline: Final rule : 06/27/2010 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/07/2009 Docket Number:",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rulemaking Project Initiated: Unknown","Docket Number: Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None      ","","","","","","","","Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None"

These proposed actions, if adopted, will clarify regulations with respect to PHMSAÛªs fireworks approval process and provide regulatory flexibility in seeking authorization for the transportation of Division 1.4G consumer fireworks.","","","","","","","","Prompting action: None","Legal Deadline: None",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rulemaking Project Initiated: 09/27/2010 Docket Number: PHMSA-2010-0320 Dates for NPRM:","Docket Number: Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ","","","Additional coordination necessary","","","","","Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None"
