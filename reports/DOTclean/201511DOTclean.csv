In completing the report Congress required under section 32104 of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), FMCSA has determined that the current financial responsibility minimums are inadequate to fully cover the costs of some crashes in light of increased medical costs and DOTÇs revised value of statistical life estimates. The FMCSA is also considering proposing to extend the financial responsibility requirements to private motor carriers, as authorized by section 4120 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU).

Other proposals in this NPRM to enhance airline passenger protections include: expanding the pool of ""reporting"" carriers; requiring enhanced reporting by mainline carriers for their domestic code-share partner operations; requiring large travel agents to adopt minimum customer service standards; codifying the statutory requirement that carriers and ticket agents disclose any code-share arrangements on their websites; and prohibiting unfair and deceptive practices such as undisclosed biasing and post-purchase price increases. The Department is also considering whether to require ticket agents to disclose the carriers whose tickets they sell in order to avoid having consumers mistakenly believe they are searching all possible flight options for a particular city-pair market when in fact there may be other options available. Additionally, this NPRM would correct drafting errors and make minor changes to the Department's second Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections rule to conform to guidance issued by the Department's Office of Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings (Enforcement Office) regarding its interpretation of the rule.","Regulatory Flexibility Act","","","","","","","Prompting action: None","","","","","","","Rulemaking Project Initiated: 04/18/2011","Docket Number: ","07/21/2015æ","12/10/2015æ","","","","","","","","","","","08/18/2015æ","01/22/2016æ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11/17/2015æ","04/20/2016æ","","","","","12/01/2015æ","04/29/2016æ","","","","","","","","","","","N/A ","","","","","","","","Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None"
