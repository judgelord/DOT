On-board hours-of-service recording devices meeting FMCSA«s current requirements and voluntarily installed in CMVs manufactured before that date could continue to be used for the remainder of the service life of those CMVs. Motor carriers that have demonstrated a history of serious noncompliance with the hours-of-service (HOS) rules would be subject to mandatory installation of EOBRs meeting the new performance standards (a remedial directive). The motor carrier would then be required to install EOBRs in all of its CMVs regardless of their date of manufacture and to use the devices for HOS recordkeeping for a period of 2 years, unless the carrier already had equipped its vehicles with automatic on-board recording devices (AOBRDs) meeting the Agency«s current requirements under 49 CFR 395.15 and could demonstrate to FMCSA that its drivers understand how to use the devices. FMCSA would encourage industry-wide use of EOBRs by providing the following incentives for motor carriers to voluntarily use EOBRs in their CMVs: Revising the Agency«s compliance review procedures to permit examination of a random sample of drivers« records of duty status; and providing partial relief from HOS supporting documents requirements, if certain conditions are satisfied.",Economically Significant Major,Information Collection Privacy,Peer Review,,,,,Prompting action: Court Action,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/09/2004,Docket Number: FMCSA-2004-18940,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Other, higher priorities Other, higher priorities Other, higher priorities Other, higher priorities Other, higher priorities","Other, higher priorities",Unanticipated issues requiring further analysis,Additional coordination necessary,,"Other, higher priorities",,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None30,Qualifications of Drivers; Diabetes Standard,200903,Popular Title: Diabetes Standard,Qualifications of Drivers; Diabetes Standard,Black,RIN 2126-AA95,Stage: Undetermined,Previous Stage: ANPRM: Publication Date 03/17/2006;End of Comment Period 06/15/2006.,"Abstract: This rulemaking action would amend FMCSA«s medical qualification standards to allow drivers with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus to operate commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce, without seeking an exemption from the FMCSRs.

CSA 2010 is a new operational model FMCSA plans to implement that is designed to help the Agency carry out its compliance and enforcement programs more efficiently and effectively. Currently, the safety fitness rating of a motor carrier is determined based on the results of a very labor intensive compliance review conducted at the carrier«s place of business. Aside from roadside inspections and new audits, the compliance review is the Agency«s primary intervention. Under CSA 2010, FMCSA would propose to implement a broader array of progressive interventions, some of which allow FMCSA to make contact with more carriers. Through this rulemaking FMCSA would establish safety fitness determinations based on safety data consisting of crashes, inspections, and violation history rather than the standard compliance review. This will enable the Agency to assess the safety performance of a greater segment of the motor carrier industry with the goal of further reducing large truck and bus crashes and fatalities.",None,,,,,,,Prompting action: Secretarial/Head of Operating Administration Decision,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 06/21/2007,Docket Number: FMCSA-2004-18898,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: Awaiting development of additional data Unanticipated impacts requiring further analysis Unanticipated impacts requiring further analysis Unanticipated impacts requiring further analysis Unanticipated impacts requiring further analysis Unanticipated impacts requiring further analysis Unanticipated impacts requiring further analysis,Unanticipated impacts requiring further analysis,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None37,Federal Railroad Administration,200903,Popular Title: Hours of Service Record Keeping,Hours of Service Record Keeping,Red,RIN 2130-AB85,Stage: NPRM,Previous Stage:None,"Abstract: This rulemaking would revise the hours of service record keeping regulations to allow for the use of electronic record keeping systems.

Section 3011 of SAFETEA-LU made a number of changes to 49 U.S.C. 5309 (""Section 5309""), which authorizes the Federal Transit Administration«s (FTA«s) capital investment grant program. SAFETEA-LU emphasized the need to improve the accuracy of the estimates of ridership and costs used to support the selection of a major capital investment (""New Start"") as a locally preferred alternative (LPA) for Section 5309 funds. Federal transit law supports the use of incentives to encourage the development of more reliable cost and ridership estimates for New Starts funded under Section 5309. A number of provisions in Section 5309 recognize that contractors to grant recipients play an important role in increasing the reliability of forecasting methods to estimate costs and utilization of New Starts projects. This rulemaking would establish a new part 612 in the Code of Federal Regulations. It would encourage accurate cost and ridership estimates through the award of additional New Starts funds to project sponsors, which they can choose to pass along to their contractors.
