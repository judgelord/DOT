On January 15, 2010, the American Trucking Associations (ATA) filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir.

ATA petitioned the court to direct FMCSA to issue an NPRM on supporting documents in conformance with the requirements set forth in section 113 of the HMTAA within 60 days after the issuance of the writ and a final rule no later than 6 months after the issuance of the NPRM. The court granted the petition for writ of mandamus on September 30, 2010, ordering FMCSA to issue an NPRM on the supporting document regulations by December 30, 2010. At the request of the agency, the DC Circuit extended the deadline to January 31, 2011. On April 5, 2010, FMCSA issued a final rule (RIN 2126-AA89) that required the use of EOBRs by motor carriers with significant hours-of-service violations (75 FR 17208). A petition for judicial review was  filed with the Seventh Circuit. On August 26, 2011, the Court vacated the final rule, which removed the technical specifications relied on in this rulemaking.

FMCSA has been discovering in its passenger bus crash investigations and roadside inspections a need for better documentation of bus equipment lease and interchange agreements. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has also recommended FMCSA require documentation of bus motor vehicle leases and interchanges based on a crash investigation in 2008 near Victoria, Texas. The preliminary scope of the proposal would be to determine two things. First, whether any or all of the present practices of motor carriers of passengers, with respect to the performance of transportation by the use of vehicles owned by others, the interchange of vehicles, and the leasing of vehicles to private motor carriers and shippers, should be discontinued because they are contrary to the public interest; and, if any or all of the present practices should be continued. Second, whether the motor carriersÎ‚ practices should be governed by regulations similar to those currently in 49 CFR Part 376 applicable presently only to motor carriers of property. The intended effect of this action is to require lessee-motor carriers of passengers assume complete responsibility for the operation of the bus equipment for the duration of the lease and document full operational control by the lessee-motor carriers of passengers over all drivers, bus vehicles, and trip operations being conducted under its USDOT registration.",Major,Information Collection,,,,,,Prompting action: Secretarial/Head of Operating Administration Decision,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 09/28/2011,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None43,Federal Railroad Administration,201111,Popular Title: Roadway Worker Protection; Adjacent-Track On-Track,Roadway Worker Protection; Adjacent-Track On-Track Safety,Red,RIN 2130-AB96,Stage: Final Rule,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 11/25/2009; End of Comment Period 1/25/2010.,"Abstract: This rulemaking would simplify the determination regarding whether or not adjacent track protection is required for roadway work groups engaged in large-scale maintenance or construction, pursuant to 49 CFR Part 214.

Second, we are considering adding a new requirement for a brake-throttle override system on light vehicles. Under certain conditions, this would require that the braking system override the throttle control in the event of a conflict. All vehicle manufacturers are in the process of equipping all of their U.S. vehicles with such technology, if they have not done so already.
