The DPA is the Presidentå«s primary authority to ensure timely availability of private sector resources for national defense. In addition to military and energy activities, the definition of ""national defense"" includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title   VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the protection and restoration of critical infrastructure. Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorization legislation, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditons. Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practacable, the rules be consistent and unifed. DOT is part of an interageny working group, along with the other delegated agencies, that is developing consistent unifed rules.","Information Collection","","","","","","","Prompting action: Statute","Legal Deadline: Final rule : 06/27/2010 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/07/2009 Docket Number:",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rulemaking Project Initiated: Unknown","Docket Number: Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ","","","Additional coordination necessary","","","","","Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None"

This change complies with a mandate in the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 (PIPES Act). Until 2008, unless a rural low stress pipeline crossed a commercially navigable waterway, a hazardous liquid pipeline operating at low-stress in a rural area was not regulated under Federal pipeline  safety regulations in 49 CFR Part 195. Section four of the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 (PIPES Act), requires PHMSA to ""issue regulations subjecting low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines to the same standards and regulations as other hazardous liquid pipelines."" The Act also provides that the new regulations could be issued in phases. PHMSA decided to implement the PIPES Act mandate in phases, in part because PHMSA did not have complete data on the extent of rural low stress pipelines that would be covered by the statutory mandate. Phase one, published in a final rule on June 3, 2008, applied full Part 195 regulation to the higher-risk, larger-diameter, rural low-stress pipelines, i.e., those low-stress pipelines with a diameter of 8 5/8-inches or greater located in or within one-half mile of an unusually sensitive area (USA). These are the rural low stress pipelines that have more potential to cause harm to unusually sensitive areas. In phase two (this rulemaking), we are applying Part 195 safety requirements to all rural low-stress pipelines not included in the phase one rule. Thus, the pipelines addressed by this  rulemaking are those rural low-stress pipelines of any diameter located more than one-half mile from a USA and those less than 8 5/8 inches in diameter located within one-half mile  of a USA.

PHMSA is considering whether   changes are needed to the regulations covering hazardous liquid onshore pipelines, whether other areas should be included as HCAs for integrity management (IM) protections, what the repair timeframes should be for areas outside the HCAs that are assessed as part of the IM program, whether leak detection standards are necessary, valve spacing requirements are needed on new construction or existing pipelines, and PHMSA should extend regulation to certain pipelines currently exempt from regulation. The agency would also address the public safety and environmental aspects any new requirements, as well as the cost implications and regulatory burden.","","","","","","","","Prompting action: None","Legal Deadline: None",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/13/2010 Docket Number: PHMSA-2010-0229 Dates for ANPRM:","Docket Number: Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for ANPRM: 75 FR 63774      ","","","","","","","","Federal Register Citation for ANPRM: 75 FR 63774"

The revisions would apply to shipments of lithium cells and batteries (but not to lithium batteries packed with or contained in equipment) and would: (1) extend the current prohibition of lithium metal cells and batteries from passenger carrying aircraft to cargo-only aircraft; (2) prohibit the transport of lithium ion cells and batteries as cargo aboard passenger-carrying aircraft; (3) impose a restriction on the location(s) on a cargo-only aircraft where lithium cells and batteries could be transported. One additional change would reduce the aircraft quantity limits for lithium cells and batteries packed with or contained in equipment.","Economically Significant","Major","","","","","","Prompting action: None","Legal Deadline: None",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rulemaking Project Initiated: 09/13/2010","Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ","","","","","","","","Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None"
