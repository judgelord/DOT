Supplemental Notice of Intent: Publication Date 12/08/2010. Supplemental Notice of Intent: Signed by DOT Secretary and EPA Administrator 7/29/2011.,"Abstract: This rulemaking would establish Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for light trucks and passenger cars for model years 2017 and beyond. This rulemaking would respond to requirements of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The statute requires that CAFE standards be prescribed separately for passenger automobiles and non-passenger automobiles to achieve a combined fleet fuel economy of at least 35 mpg by model year 2020. For model years 2021 and beyond, the statute requires that the average fuel economy required to be attained by each fleet of passenger and non-passenger automobiles be the maximum feasible for each model year. The law requires the standards be set at least 18 months prior to the start of the model year. On May 21, 2010, President Obama issued a memorandum directing NHTSA and EPA to conduct a joint rulemaking (NHTSA regulating fuel economy and EPA regulating greenhouse gas emissions), and to issue a Notice of Intent to Issue a Proposed Rule (NOI) by September 30, 2010.",Economically Significant Major,EIS EU,NAFTA,Foreign,,,,Prompting action: Statute,Legal Deadline: Final rule: : 04/01/2015 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 05/27/2010 Docket Number: NHTSA-2010-0131 Dates for NPRM:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: Unknown,Docket Number: Unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ,,,Additional coordination necessary,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None2,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,201112,Popular Title: Mandatory EDR Requirements,Mandatory Part 563 Event Data Recorder Requirements,Yellow,RIN 2127-AK86,Stage: NPRM,Previous Stage:None,"Abstract: This rulemaking would establish a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard to mandate the installation of Event Data Recorders (EDR) in light vehicles. The standard would incorporate the current 49 CFR Part 563, which established the current reporting requirement of voluntarily installed EDRs in light vehicles. Part 563 presently requires vehicle manufacturers who are voluntarily installing EDRs to be in compliance with the regulation by September 1, 2012. This rulemaking would not affect the 2012 compliance date for voluntarily-installed EDRs. Furthermore, this rulemaking would not modify any of the Part 563 data elements, data capture and format requirements, data retrieval specifications, or data survivability and crash test requirements. Moreover, this rulemaking to mandate EDRs across the entire light vehicle fleet could contribute to advancements in vehicle designs, and advanced restraint and other safety countermeasures. The estimated total incremental costs associated with this rulemaking would be $24.4 million (2009 dollars), which is measured from a baseline of 91.6 percent EDR installation to 100 percent installation, assuming the sale of 15.5 million light vehicles per year.",,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 02/22/2011,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/A Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None3,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,201112,Popular Title: Light Vehicle Upgrade of EDR Requirements,Upgrade of Event Data Recorder Requirements,Red,RIN 2127-AK87,Stage: Undetermined,Previous Stage:None,"Abstract: This rulemaking would expand the utility of the amount and type of data Event Data Recorders (EDRs) capture in light vehicles in the event of a crash. The rulemaking would consider requiring some of the optional data elements specified in 49 CFR Part 563. Part 563 established the current reporting requirement of voluntarily installed EDRs in light vehicles. In addition, this rulemaking would make revisions to the optional data elements to account for the latest advances in vehicle safety. Part 563 presently requires vehicle manufacturers who are voluntarily installing EDRs to be in compliance with the regulation by September 1, 2012. In a separate rulemaking (2127-AK86 Mandatory Part 563 Event Data Recorder Requirements), the agency would propose requiring that all light vehicles comply with the requirements specified in current 49 CFR 563. This rulemaking would seek additional information from the public and expand upon that initiative. Moreover, this rulemaking would contribute to advancements in vehicle designs, advanced restraints and other safety countermeasures. The costs are expected to be minimal since some vehicle manufacturers presently capture additional data beyond Part 563 in their EDRs.

In response, NHTSA requested public comment on the subject and received thousands of comments supporting the petitioner‰Ûªs request. Based on the available safety data and the ancillary benefit of reduced fuel consumption, this rulemaking would consider a new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard that would require the installation of speed limiting devices on heavy trucks. We believe this rule would have minimal cost, as all heavy trucks already have these devices installed, although some vehicles do not have the limit set. This rule would decrease the estimated 8991 fatalities caused by crashes involving heavy trucks and buses.

Rollover and loss of control crashes involving heavy vehicles is a serious safety issue that is responsible for 304 fatalities and 2,738 injuries annually. They are also a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions of dollars of lost productivity and excess energy consumption each year. Suppliers and truck and motorcoach manufacturers have developed stability control technology for heavy vehicles to mitigate these types of crashes. Our preliminary estimate produces an effectiveness range of thirty-seven to fifty-six percent against single-vehicle tractor-trailer rollover crashes and three to fourteen percent against  loss of control crashes that result from skidding on the road surface. With these effectiveness estimates, annually, we estimate 29 - 66 lives would be saved, 517 - 979 MAIS 1-5 injuries would be reduced, and 810 - 1,693 crashes that involved property damage only would be eliminated. Additionally, it would save $10 - $26 million in property damage and travel delays. Based on the technology unit costs and affected vehicles, we estimate technology costs would be $55 to 107 million, annually. However, the costs savings from reducing travel delay and property damage would produce net benefits of $128 - $372 million.",Economically Significant Major,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 03/18/2011,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ,,,Additional coordination necessary,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None8,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,201112,Popular Title: Novelty Helmets Enforcement,FMVSS No. 218 and Enforcement Policy Concerning Novelty Helmets,Green,RIN 2127-AL01,Stage: NPRM,Previous Stage:None,Abstract: This rulemaking would establish an enforcement policy regarding novelty motorcycle helmets.

Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorization legislation, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditons.
