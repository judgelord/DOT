The Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) require shipments stored during transportation to conform to the same requirements that apply when the shipments are actually moving and for the shipping company to have security plans covering its shipments. Otherwise, the HMR do not include  specific requirements for facilities at which explosives or other high-hazard materials are stored during transportation. The HMR do not establish specific standards for storage facilities nor do they limit the amount of material that may be stored in a single location. Through this rulemaking, the agency will evaluate the adequacy of existing regulations and the need for additional, more specific requirements.
