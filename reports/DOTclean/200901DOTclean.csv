It would also revise the application form, OP-1MX, to be filed by these Mexican motor carriers. The revised form would require additional information about the applicant\\\‚s business and operating practices to allow the FMCSA to determine if the applicant can meet the safety standards established for operating in interstate commerce in the United States.

It also would establish suspension and revocation procedures for provisional Certificates of Registration and operating authority, and incorporate criteria to be used by FMCSA in evaluating whether Mexico-domiciled carriers exercise basic safety management controls. The interim rule included requirements that were not proposed in the NPRM but which are necessary to comply with the FY-2002 DOT Appropriations Act.

It also would make clarifying changes to some of the existing new entrant regulations. The rule also proposes a separate application procedure and safety oversight system for non-North America-domiciled motor carriers. The proposed rule would improve the Agencyês ability to identify at-risk new entrant carriers and would ensure deficiencies in basic safety management controls are corrected before the new entrant is granted permanent registration. These changes would not impose additional operational requirements on any new entrant carrier. All new entrants would continue to receive educational information on how to comply with the safety regulations and be given an opportunity to correct any deficiencies found.

On-board hours-of- service recording devices meeting FMCSA‚s current requirements and voluntarily installed in CMVs manufactured before that date could continue to be used for the remainder of the service life of those CMVs. Motor carriers that have demonstrated a history of serious noncompliance with the hours-of-service (HOS) rules would be subject to mandatory installation of EOBRs meeting the new performance standards (a remedial directive). The motor carrier would then be required to install EOBRs in all of its CMVs regardless of their date of manufacture and to use the devices for HOS recordkeeping for a period of 2 years, unless the carrier already had equipped its vehicles with automatic on- board recording devices (AOBRDs) meeting the Agency‚s current requirements under 49 CFR 395.15 and could demonstrate to FMCSA that its drivers understand how to use the devices. FMCSA would encourage industry-wide use of EOBRs by providing the following incentives for motor carriers to voluntarily use EOBRs in their CMVs: Revising the Agency‚s compliance review procedures to permit examination of a random sample of drivers‚ records of duty status; and providing partial relief from HOS supporting documents requirements, if certain conditions are satisfied.",Economically Significant Major,Information Collection Privacy,Peer Review,,,,,Prompting action: Court Action,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/09/2004,Docket Number: FMCSA-2004-18940,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: Other, higher priorities Additional coordination necessary Unanticipated issues requiring further analysis Additional coordination necessary Unanticipated issues requiring further analysis Additional coordination necessary Unanticipated issues requiring further analysis Additional coordination necessary Unanticipated issues requiring further analysis Additional coordination necessary Unanticipated issues requiring further analysis Additional coordination necessary Unanticipated issues requiring further analysis",Additional coordination necessary Unanticipated issues requiring further analysis,,Additional coordination necessary,,"Other, higher priorities",Unanticipated issues requiring further analysis,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None33,Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,200901,Popular Title: Diabetes Standard,Qualifications of Drivers; Diabetes Standard,Black,RIN 2126-AA95,Stage: Undetermined,Previous Stage: ANPRM: Publication Date 03/17/2006;End of Comment Period 06/15/2006.,"Abstract: This rulemaking action would amend FMCSA‚s medical qualification standards to allow drivers with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus to operate commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce, without seeking an exemption from the FMCSRs.",None,,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/10/2005,Docket Number: FMCSA-2005-23151,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Explanation for any delay: N/ Federal Register Citation for Undetermined: None      ,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Undetermined: None34,Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,200901,Popular Title: National Registry,National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners,Red,RIN 2126-AA97,Stage: NPRM,Previous Stage:None,"Abstract: This rulemaking would establish training, testing and certification standards for medical examiners responsible for certifying that interstate commercial motor vehicle drivers meet established physical qualifications standards; provide a database (or National Registry) of medical examiners that meet the prescribed standards for use by motor carriers, drivers, and Federal and State enforcement personnel in determining whether a medical examiner is qualified to conduct examinations of interstate truck and bus drivers; and require medical examiners to transmit electronically to FMCSA the name of the driver and a numerical identifier for each driver that is examined.

CSA 2010 is a new operational model FMCSA plans to implement that is designed to help the Agency carry out its compliance and enforcement programs more efficiently and effectively. Currently, the safety fitness rating of a motor carrier is determined based on the results of a very labor intensive compliance review conducted at the carrier‚s place of business. Aside from roadside inspections and new audits, the compliance review is the Agency‚s primary intervention. Under CSA 2010, FMCSA would propose to implement a broader array of progressive interventions, some of which allow FMCSA to make contact with more carriers. Through this rulemaking FMCSA would establish safety fitness determinations based on safety data consisting of crashes, inspections, and violation history rather than the standard compliance review. This will enable the Agency to assess the safety performance of a greater segment of the motor carrier industry with the goal of further reducing large truck and bus crashes and fatalities.",None,,,,,,,Prompting action: Secretarial/Head of Operating Administration Decision,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 06/21/2007 Docket Number: FMCSA-2004-18898 Dates for NPRM:,Docket Number: Unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: Other, higher priorities Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None      ",,,,,"Other, higher priorities",,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None40,Federal Railroad Administration,200901,Popular Title: Pressurized Tank Cars,Amendments to Design Standards for Pressurized Railroad Tank Cars,Yellow,RIN 2130-AB69,Stage: Final Rule,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 04/01/2008;End of Comment Period 06/02/2008,"Abstract: This rulemaking would amend the existing design standards for pressurized tank cars pursuant to section 9005 of SAFETEA-LU.
