Specifically, the FAA would add notification requirements and obstruction standards for electromagnetic interference and amend the obstruction standards for civil airport imaginary surfaces to more closely align these standards with FAA airport design and instrument approach procedure criteria. In addition, the FAA would increase the number of days in which notice must be filed with the FAA before beginning construction or alteration; add and amend definitions for terms commonly used during the aeronautical evaluation process; and remove the provisions for public hearings and antenna farms. The FAA would retitle the rule and reformat it into sections that closely reflect the aeronautical study process.

The motor carrier would then be required to install EOBRs in all of its CMVs regardless of their date of manufacture and to use the devices for HOS recordkeeping for a period of 2 years, unless the carrier already had equipped its vehicles with automatic on-board recording devices (AOBRDs) meeting the Agency_s current requirements under 49 CFR 395.15 and could demonstrate to FMCSA that its drivers understand how to use the devices. FMCSA would encourage industry-wide use of EOBRs by providing the following incentives for motor carriers to voluntarily use EOBRs in their CMVs: Revising the Agency_s compliance review procedures to permit examination of a random sample of drivers_ records of duty status; and providing partial relief from HOS supporting documents requirements, if certain conditions are satisfied.",Economically Significant Major,Information Collection Privacy,Peer Review,,,,,Prompting action: Court Action,Legal Deadline: None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/09/2004,Docket Number: FMCSA-2004-18940,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary Other, higher priorities Other, higher priorities Other, higher priorities Other, higher priorities Other, higher priorities","Other, higher priorities",Unanticipated issues requiring further analysis,Additional coordination necessary,,"Other, higher priorities",,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None36,Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,200910,Popular Title: Diabetes Standard,Qualifications of Drivers; Diabetes Standard,Black,RIN 2126-AA95,Stage: Undetermined,Previous Stage: ANPRM: Publication Date 03/17/2006;End of Comment Period 06/15/2006.

Aside from roadside inspections and new audits, the compliance review is the Agency_s primary intervention. Under CSA 2010, FMCSA would propose to implement a broader array of progressive interventions, some of which allow FMCSA to make contact with more carriers. Through this rulemaking FMCSA would establish safety fitness determinations based on safety data consisting of crashes, inspections, and violation history rather than the standard compliance review.
