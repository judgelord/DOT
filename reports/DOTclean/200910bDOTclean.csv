It would require operators to develop, implement, and submit to PHMSA (or the appropriate State), a human factors management plan designed to reduce risks associated with human factors. This would require operators to include in their plans a maximum limit on the hours of service for individuals employed as controllers. It would also require operators to periodically review their management of computer-based control system alarms and to verify that the control systems provide accurate and timely information to controllers.

In particular, PHMSA is examining what, if any, safety benefits would accrue from a requirement for persons conducting bulk loading and unloading operations to develop and implement operating procedures governing these operations.
