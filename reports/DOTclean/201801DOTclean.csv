However, other three-wheeled vehicles have passenger-car characteristics such as fully enclosed cabins, hinged doors with roll-up windows, steering wheels, and side-by-side seating. Because these car-like vehicles ride on three wheels instead of four, they are not required to meet federal safety standards for passenger cars (although they are subject to motorcycle safety standards.) Various car-like three-wheeled vehicle models have been imported into the U.S. and have been available for sale to the public.

To further implement the statute, the regulations would condition the importation of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment upon the manufacturer's compliance with: (a) certain statutory provisions; (b) a request from NHTSA for reports and records the manufacturer is required to maintain with respect to the vehicle or equipment; (c) a request from NHTSA for inspection of premises or of the vehicle or equipment; (d) an order or voluntary agreement to remedy a safety-related defect or a noncompliance with a Federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) in the vehicle or equipment; and (e) regulations implementing these requirements.
