Part 563 presently requires vehicle manufacturers who are voluntarily installing EDRs to be in compliance with the regulation by September 1, 2012.

We believe this rule will have minimal cost, as all heavy trucks already have these devices installed, although some vehicles do not have the limit set.

Rollover and loss of control crashes involving heavy vehicles is a serious safety issue that is responsible for 304 fatalities and 2,738 injuries annually. They are also a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions of dollars of lost productivity and excess energy consumption each year. Suppliers and truck and motorcoach manufacturers have developed stability control technology for heavy vehicles to mitigate these types of crashes. Our preliminary estimate produces an effectiveness range of thirty-seven to fifty-six percent against single-vehicle tractor-trailer rollover crashes and three to fourteen percent against  loss of control crashes that result from skidding on the road surface. With these effectiveness estimates, annually, we estimate 29 - 66 lives would be saved, 517 - 979 MAIS 1-5 injuries would be reduced, and 810 - 1,693 crashes that involved property damage only would be eliminated. Additionally, it would save $10 - $26 million in property damage and travel delays. Based on the technology unit costs and affected vehicles, we estimate technology costs would be $55 to 107 million, annually. However, the costs savings from reducing travel delay and property damage would produce net benefits of $128 - $372 million.",,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,Economically Significant Major,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 03/18/2011,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,Originally Scheduled,,New Projected,,Actual Date,,,,,,Date,,Date,,,,,,To OST,,05/11/2011,,08/12/2011,,,,,,To OMB,,06/23/2011,,09/24/2011,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,09/23/2011,,12/23/2011,,,,,,Publication Date,,09/30/2011,,12/30/2011,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,11/30/2011,,03/02/2012,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,Office of the Secretary,,,,,,,,,,77.,,,,,,,,,,Office of the Secretary,,,,,,,,,,"Transportation for Individuals with Disabilites"" Miscellaneous Amendments",,,,,,,,,,RedPopular Title: ADA Miscellaneous Amendments,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2105-AD54,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Final Rule,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 02/27/2006; End of Comment Period 4/28/2006; Extension of Comment Period 5/1/2006; End of Extended Comment Period 7/28/2006.,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would amend several regulations regarding rail station platform standards, reasonable modifications of policies and procedures, and pedestrian access; it would also codify existing DOT procedures for issuing interpretations and guidance.",,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/15/2005,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: OST-2006-23985,,,,,,,,,,Dates for Final Rule:,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,Originally Scheduled Date,,New Projected Date,,Actual Date,,,,,To OST,12/01/2010,,05/02/2011,,03/21/2011,,,,,To OMB,01/08/2011,,05/31/2011,,05/04/2011,,,,,OMB Clearance,04/08/2011,,08/31/2011,,,,,,,Publication Date,04/15/2011,,09/13/2011,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None,,,,,,,,,,Office of the Secretary,,,,,,,,,,Protection of Sensitive Security Information,,,,,,,,,,Red78.,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: SSI-TSA,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2105-AD59,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Final Rule,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: Interim Final Rule: Publication Date 05/18/2004; End of Comment Period 07/19/2004.,,,,,,,,,,Abstract: This rulemaking would finalize a May 2004 interim final rule and respond to any,,,,,,,,,,comments received on that action.

Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation.

The final rule established an 18-month program development deadline of August 1, 2011, and a subsequent 18-month program implementation deadline of February   1, 2013. This rulemaking would expedite the program implementation deadline to August 1, 2011, for most of the requirements, except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management, which would have a program implementation deadline of August 1, 2012. The final ruleå«s regulatory analysis did not consider specific costs for  the program implementation deadlines, because the costs associated with the rule were determined to be the first-year program implementation costs, and were not dependent on the implementation deadline. PHMSA believes that the 18 months provided for program development is sufficient for pipeline operators to both develop and implement certain provisions of the rule. Where PHMSA believes there is a need for additional program implementation time, the rulemaking would moderately shorten that time by only six months.
