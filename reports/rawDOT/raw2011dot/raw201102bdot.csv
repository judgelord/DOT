This rulemaking would respond to requirements of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The statute requires that CAFE standards be prescribed separately for passenger automobiles and non-passenger automobiles to achieve a combined fleet fuel economy of at least 35 mpg by model year 2020. For model years 2021 and beyond, the statute requires that the average fuel economy required to be attained by each fleet of passenger and non-passenger automobiles be the maximum feasible for each model year. The law requires the standards be set at least 18 months prior to the start of the model year. On May 21, 2010, President Obama issued a memorandum directing NHTSA and EPA to conduct a joint rulemaking (NHTSA regulating fuel economy and EPA regulating greenhouse gas emissions), and to issue a Notice of Intent to Issue a Proposed Rule (NOI) by September 30, 2010.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economically Significant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Major EIS EU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NAFTA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Foreign,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: Final rule: : 04/01/2015 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 12/19/2007 Docket Number: NHTSA-2010-0131 Dates for Supplemental Notice of Intent:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,,Actual Date,,,,,,,,,,To OST,11/19/2010,,,,,,,11/22/2010,,,,,,,,,,To OMB,11/19/2010,,,,,,,11/22/2010,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,12/19/2010,,,,,,,11/30/2010,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,12/31/2010,,,,,,,12/08/2010,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Supplemental Notice of Intent: 75 FR 76337,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tire Fuel Efficiency Petitions for Reconsideration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Black,69.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Tire Fuel Efficiency Reconsideration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2127-AK83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Reconsideration of Final Rule,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would address petitions for reconsideration the agency received on its final rule (75 FR 15893), published in response to requirements in the Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007 to establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program for replacement tires designed for use on motor vehicles.

In addition to military and energy activities, the definition of ""national defense"" includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title   VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the protection and restoration of critical infrastructure. Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorization legislation, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practacable, the rules be consistent and unifed.

This change complies with a mandate in the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 (PIPES Act). Until 2008, unless a rural low stress pipeline crossed a commercially navigable waterway, a hazardous liquid pipeline operating at low-stress in a rural area was not regulated under Federal pipeline  safety regulations in 49 CFR Part 195. Section four of the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 (PIPES Act), requires PHMSA to ""issue regulations subjecting low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines to the same standards and regulations as other hazardous liquid pipelines."" The Act also provides that the new regulations could be issued in phases. PHMSA decided to implement the PIPES Act mandate in phases, in part because PHMSA did not have complete data on the extent of rural low stress pipelines that would be covered by the statutory mandate. Phase one, published in a final rule on June 3, 2008, applied full Part 195 regulation to the higher-risk, larger-diameter, rural low-stress pipelines, i.e., those low-stress pipelines with a diameter of 8 5/8-inches or greater located in or within one-half mile of an unusually sensitive area (USA). These are the rural low stress pipelines that have more potential to cause harm to unusually sensitive areas. In phase two (this rulemaking), we are applying Part 195 safety requirements to all rural low-stress pipelines not included in the phase one rule. Thus, the pipelines addressed by this  rulemaking are those rural low-stress pipelines of any diameter located more than one-half mile from a USA and those less than 8 5/8 inches in diameter located within one-half mile  of a USA.

The final rule established an 18-month program development deadline of August 1, 2011, and a subsequent 18-month program implementation deadline of February  1, 2013. This notice proposes to expedite the program implementation deadline to August 1, 2011, for most of the requirements, except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management, which would have a program implementation deadline of August 1, 2012. The final ruleÛªs regulatory analysis did not consider specific costs for the program implementation deadlines because the costs associated with the rule were determined to be the first year program implementation costs, and were not dependent on the implementation deadline. PHMSA believes that the 18 months provided for program development is sufficient for pipeline operators to both develop and implement certain provisions of the rule.
