The National Academy provided Congress and NHTSA with this report on March 18, 2010. EISA then requires that NHTSA complete a study that examines the fuel efficiency of commercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work trucks and determines the appropriate test procedures and methodologies for measuring the fuel efficiency of such vehicles, the appropriate metric for measuring the fuel efficiency of such vehicles, the range of factors that affect the fuel efficiency of these vehicles, and other factors that could impact a program to improve the fuel efficiency of these vehicles.

Rollover and loss of control crashes involving heavy vehicles is a serious safety issue that is responsible for 304 fatalities and 2,738 injuries annually. They are also a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions of dollars of lost productivity and excess energy consumption each year. Suppliers and truck and motorcoach manufacturers have developed stability control technology for heavy vehicles to mitigate these types of crashes. Our preliminary estimate produces an effectiveness range of thirty-seven to fifty-six percent",,,,,,,,,,,against single-vehicle tractor-trailer rollover crashes and three to fourteen percent against,,,,,,,,,,,"loss of control crashes that result from skidding on the road surface. With these effectiveness estimates, annually, we estimate 29 - 66 lives would be saved, 517 - 979 MAIS 1-5 injuries would be reduced, and 810 - 1,693 crashes that involved property damage only would be eliminated. Additionally, it would save $10 - $26 million in property damage and travel delays.

Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense.
