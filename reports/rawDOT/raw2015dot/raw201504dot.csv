Rollover and loss of control crashes involving heavy vehicles is a serious safety issue that is responsible for 304 fatalities and 2,738 injuries annually. They are also a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions of dollars of lost productivity and excess energy consumption each year. Suppliers and truck and motorcoach manufacturers have developed stability control technology for heavy vehicles to mitigate these types of crashes. Our preliminary estimate produces an effectiveness range of thirty-seven to fifty-six percent against single-vehicle tractor-trailer rollover crashes and three to fourteen percent against loss of control crashes that result from skidding on the road surface. With these effectiveness estimates, annually, we estimate 29 - 66 lives would be saved, 517 - 979 MAIS 1-5 injuries would be reduced, and 810 - 1,693 crashes that involved property damage only would be eliminated. Additionally, it would save $10 - $26 million in property damage and travel delays. Based on the technology unit costs and affected vehicles, we estimate technology costs would be $55 to 107 million, annually. However, the costs savings from reducing travel delay and property damage would produce net benefits of $128 - $372 million.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that if adopted would, among other things, create a pathway for airlines to permit the use of cellphones or other mobile wireless devices to make or receive calls on board aircraft. DOT supports the FCC's proposal to revise its rules in light of the technology available and to expand access to mobile wireless data services on board aircraft; however, under the Department's aviation consumer protection authority and because of concerns raised, we are seeking comment on whether to ban voice calls on aircraft.

Currently, the majority of the rail community transporting oil, including crude oil transported as a hazardous material, is subject to the basic oil spill response plan requirement of 49 CFR 130.31(a) based on the understanding that most rail tank cars being used to transport crude oil have a capacity greater than 3,500 gallons. However, a comprehensive response plan for the shipment of oil is only required when the oil is in a quantity greater than 42,000 gallons per package. Tank cars of this size are not used to transport oil by rail. As a result, the railroads do not file a comprehensive oil response plan. Based on this difference and the recent occurrence of high-profile accidents involving crude oil, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recommended in Safety Recommendation R-14-5 that the Department and PHMSA reconsider the threshold quantity for requiring the development of a comprehensive response plan for the shipment of oil. In response to the NTSB Safety Recommendation R-14-5 and significant interest from Congressional stakeholders, environmental groups, and the general public, PHMSA is seeking specific comment on revisions to the oil spill response plan requirements in 49 CFR part 130, including threshold quantities.
