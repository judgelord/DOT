Currently, there are over 52,000 annual ejections in motor vehicle crashes, and over 10,000 ejected fatalities per year. This rulemaking would propose new requirements for reducing occupant ejection through passenger vehicle side widows. The requirement would be an occupant containment requirement on the amount of allowable excursion through passenger vehicle side windows. The SAFETEA-LU legislation requires that: ""[t]he Secretary shall also initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish performance standards to reduce complete and partial ejections of vehicle occupants from outboard seating positions. In formulating the  standards the Secretary shall consider various ejection mitigation systems. The Secretary shall issue a final rule under this paragraph no later than October 1, 2009.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economically Significant Major,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unfunded Mandate EU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NAFTA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Foreign,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: Final Rule : 10/01/2009 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/10/2005 Docket Number:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,Actual Date,,,,,,To OST,,04/30/2008,,,03/14/2009,,,,,,,,,To OMB,,06/30/2008,,,04/20/2009,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,09/25/2008,,,07/19/2009,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,09/28/2008,,,07/30/2009,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,11/30/2008,,,08/30/2009,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Passenger Car and Light Truck Corporate Average Fuel Economy Model Year 2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,48.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: MY 2011 CAFE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2127-AK29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Final Rule/2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication 5/02/2008; End of Comment Period 7/01/2008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Abstract: This rulemaking would address Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards for light trucks and for passenger cars for model year 2011.
