The rule amended existing flight, duty, and rest regulations applicable to certificate holders conducting passenger-carrying operations and their flightcrew members operating under 14 CFR part 121. The rule eliminated distinctions between domestic, flag, and supplemental operations. Also, the rule provided different requirements based on the time of day, whether an individual is acclimated to a new time zone, and the likelihood of being able to sleep under different circumstances.

In completing the report Congress required under section 32104 of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), FMCSA has determined that the current financial responsibility minimums are inadequate to fully cover the costs of some crashes in light of increased medical costs and DOT?s revised value of statistical life estimates. The FMCSA is also considering extending the financial responsibility requirements to private motor carriers, as authorized by section 4120 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU).

Rollover and loss of control crashes involving heavy vehicles is a serious safety issue that is responsible for 304 fatalities and 2,738 injuries annually. They are also a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions of dollars of lost productivity and excess energy consumption each year. Suppliers and truck and motorcoach manufacturers have developed stability control technology for heavy vehicles to mitigate these types of crashes. Our preliminary estimate produces an effectiveness range of thirty-seven to fifty-six percent against single-vehicle tractor-trailer rollover crashes and three to fourteen percent against loss of control crashes that result from skidding on the road surface. With these effectiveness estimates, annually, we estimate 29 - 66 lives would be saved, 517 - 979 MAIS 1-5 injuries would be reduced, and 810 - 1,693 crashes that involved property damage only would be eliminated. Additionally, it would save $10 - $26 million in property damage and travel delays. Based on the technology unit costs and affected vehicles, we estimate technology costs would be $55 to 107 million, annually. However, the costs savings from reducing travel delay and property damage would produce net benefits of $128 - $372 million.

Under the existing regulatory definition of motorcycle in Part 571.3, three-wheeled motor vehicles are classified as motorcycles. This is appropriate for motorcycles with sidecars, trikes, and other three-wheeled vehicles that are based on a motorcycle-like configuration. However, other three-wheeled vehicles have passenger-car characteristics such as fully enclosed cabins, hinged doors with roll-up windows, steering wheels, and side-by-side seating. Because these car-like vehicles ride on three wheels instead of four, they are not required to meet federal safety standards for passenger cars (although they are subject to motorcycle safety standards.) Various car-like three-wheeled vehicle models have been imported into the U.S. and have been available for sale to the public.

In order to meet the statutory rulemaking requirements and to award all grants in a timely manner in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, NHTSA proceeded with an expedited rulemaking by taking a two-pronged approach. First, on, October 5, 2012, NHTSA issued a non-significant notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the minimum requirements for the GDL grant (RIN 2127-AL29). NHTSA then incorporated the GDL provisions, including addressing comments in response to the NPRM, into the Interim Final Rule for all of the grants.",,,Effects:,,,,None ,,Prompting action: Statute,,,Legal Deadline:ÊNone,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 07/06/2012,,,Docket Number: ,,,Dates for Undetermined:,,,Milestone,Originally,New,Actual,Scheduled,Projected,Date,Date,Date,To OST ,,,To OMB ,,,OMB Clearance ,,,Publication Date ,,,End of Comment Period ,,,Explanation for any delay:,N/A ,,Federal Register Citation for Undetermined: None,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,83.Ê,,Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles and Work Trucks: Phase 2,BlackPopular Title: MDHD Cafe Phase 2,,,RIN 2127-AL52,,,Stage: NPRM,,,Previous Stage:None ,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would address fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work trucks for model years beyond 2018. This rulemaking would respond to requirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), Title 1, Subtitle A, Sections 102 and 108, as they amend 49 USC ¤ 32902, which was signed into law December 19, 2007. The statute requires that NHTSA establish a medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicle and work truck fuel efficiency improvement program that achieves the maximum feasible improvement, including standards that are appropriate, cost-effective, and technologically feasible. The law requires that the new standards provide at least 4 full model years of regulatory lead-time and 3 full model years of regulatory stability (i.e., the standards must remain in effect for 3 years before they may be amended). This action would follow the first ever Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles (?Phase 1?) (76 FR 57106, September 15, 2011). In June, 2013, the PresidentÕs Climate Action Plan called for the Department of Transportation to develop fuel efficiency standards and the Environmental Protection Agency to develop greenhouse gas emission standards in joint rulemaking within the PresidentÕs second term. In February, 2014, the President directed DOT and EPA to complete the second phase of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles during his second term.",,,Effects:,,,,Economically Significant,,,Major,,,Unfunded Mandate,,Prompting action: None,,,Legal Deadline:ÊNone,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 04/01/2014,,,Docket Number: ,,,Dates for NPRM:,,,Milestone,Originally,New,Actual,Scheduled,Projected,Date,Date,Date,To OST ,11/23/2014Ê,,To OMB ,12/27/2014Ê,,OMB Clearance ,03/26/2015Ê,,Publication Date ,03/31/2015Ê,,End of Comment Period ,05/30/2015Ê,,Explanation for any delay:,N/A ,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,84.Ê,,Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 150 ?

V2V technology can also be fused with vehicle-resident technologies to potentially provide greater benefits than either approach alone. V2V can augment vehicle-resident systems by acting as a complete system, extending the ability of the overall safety system to address other crash scenarios not covered by V2V communications, such as lane and road departure.

The Department is also considering whether to require ticket agents to disclose the carriers whose tickets they sell in order to avoid having consumers mistakenly believe they are searching all possible flight options for a particular city-pair market when in fact there may be other options available.

Further, FRA has identified several trends in industry practices and operating procedures that present new and different risks to safety that should be addressed in Part 174 of the HMR.

Currently, the majority of the rail community transporting oil, including crude oil transported as a hazardous material, is subject to the basic oil spill response plan requirement of 49 CFR 130.31(a) based on the understanding that most rail tank cars being used to transport crude oil have a capacity greater than 3,500 gallons. However, a comprehensive response plan for the shipment of oil is only required when the oil is in a quantity greater than 42,000 gallons per package. Tank cars of this size are not used to transport oil by rail. As a result, the railroads do not file a comprehensive oil response plan. Based on this difference and the recent occurrence of high-profile accidents involving crude oil, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recommended in Safety Recommendation R-14-5 that the Department and PHMSA reconsider the threshold quantity for requiring the development of a comprehensive response plan for the shipment of oil. In response to the NTSB Safety Recommendation R-14-5 and significant interest from Congressional stakeholders, environmental groups, and the general public, PHMSA is seeking specific comment on revisions to the oil spill response plan requirements in 49 CFR part 130, including threshold quantities.
