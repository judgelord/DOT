In August 2007, NHTSA published a motorcoach safety plan identifying four specific priority items: seat belts on motorcoaches, rollover structural integrity, emergency evacuation, and fire safety. The DOT published a comprehensive motorcoach safety action plan in November 2009 that reiterated NHTSAå«s motorcoach safety priorities. This rulemaking also addresses 6 recommendations issued by the NTSB on motorcoach roof strength and structural integrity and is responsive to requirements of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) Act.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: Publish Final Rule : 07/05/2014 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 03/18/2011 Docket Number:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,,New Projected Date,,,,Actual Date,,,,,,To OST,,,08/12/2011,,,,10/28/2011,,,,11/10/2011,,,,,,Returned to Mode,,,,,,,,,,,05/11/2012,,,,,,To OMB,,,09/23/2011,,,,08/16/2012,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,,12/23/2011,,,,11/15/2012,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,,12/30/2011,,,,11/30/2012,,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,,03/02/2012,,,,01/30/2013,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Electronic Stability Control Systems for Heavy Vehicles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Red67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Truck Tractor Electronic Stability Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2127-AK97,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Undetermined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: NPRM 05/23/12; End of C/P: 08/21/12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would promulgate a new Federal standard that would require stability control systems on truck tractors and motorcoaches that address both rollover and loss of control crashes, after an extensive research program to evaluate the available technologies, an evaluation of the costs and benefits, and a review of manufacturerå«s product plans. Rollover and loss of control crashes involving heavy vehicles is a serious safety issue that is responsible for 304 fatalities and 2,738 injuries annually. They are also a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions of dollars of lost productivity and excess energy consumption each year. Suppliers and truck and motorcoach manufacturers have developed stability control technology for heavy vehicles to mitigate these types of crashes. Our preliminary estimate produces an effectiveness range of thirty-seven to fifty-six percent against single-vehicle tractor-trailer rollover crashes and three to fourteen percent against  loss of control crashes that result from skidding on the road surface. With these effectiveness estimates, annually, we estimate 29 - 66 lives would be saved, 517 - 979 MAIS 1-5 injuries would be reduced, and 810 - 1,693 crashes that involved property damage only would be eliminated. Additionally, it would save $10 - $26 million in property damage and travel delays. Based on the technology unit costs and affected vehicles, we estimate technology costs would be $55 to 107 million, annually. However, the costs savings from reducing travel delay and property damage would produce net benefits of $128 - $372 million.

Under the existing regulatory definition of motorcycle in Part 571.3, three-wheeled motor vehicles are classified as motorcycles. This is appropriate for motorcycles with sidecars, trikes, and other three- wheeled vehicles that are based on a motorcycle-like configuration. However, other three- wheeled vehicles have passenger-car characteristics such as fully enclosed cabins, hinged doors with roll-up windows, steering wheels, and side-by-side seating. Because these car- like vehicles ride on three wheels instead of four, they are not required to meet federal safety standards for passenger cars (although they are subject to motorcycle safety standards.) Various car-like three-wheeled vehicle models have been imported into the U.S. and have been available for sale to the public. NHTSA believes consumers who purchase these vehicles are likely to assume that these vehicles have the same safety features and crash protection as passenger cars certified to federal safety standards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 02/10/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,,New Projected Date,,,,Actual Date,,,,,,To OST,,,10/04/2012,,,,11/14/2012,,,,,,,,,,To OMB,,,11/22/2012,,,,12/20/2012,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,,02/21/2013,,,,03/20/2013,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,,02/26/2013,,,,03/31/2013,,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,,04/27/2013,,,,05/30/2013,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Office of the Secretary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: SSI-TSA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2105-AD59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Undetermined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Office of the Secretary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Protection of Sensitive Security Information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RedPrevious Stage: Interim Final Rule: Publication Date 05/18/2004; End of Comment Period,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,07/19/2004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Abstract: This rulemaking would finalize a May 2004 interim final rule and respond to any comments received on that action.

The DPA is the Presidentå«s primary authority to ensure timely availability of private sector resources for national defense. In addition to military and energy activities, the definition of ""national defense"" includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title   VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the protection and restoration of critical infrastructure. Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorization legislation, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practicable, the rules be consistent and unified.
