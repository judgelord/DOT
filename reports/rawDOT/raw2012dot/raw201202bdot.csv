In response, NHTSA requested public comment on the subject and received thousands of comments supporting the petitioner‰Ûªs request. Based on the available safety data and the ancillary benefit of reduced fuel consumption, this rulemaking would consider a new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard that would require the installation of speed limiting devices on heavy trucks. We believe this rule would have minimal cost, as all heavy trucks already have these devices installed, although some vehicles do not have the limit set. This rule would decrease the estimated 8991 fatalities caused by crashes involving heavy trucks and buses. It would also increase the fleet fuel efficiency of these vehicles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economically Significant Major,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 03/18/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,Actual Date,,,,,,To OST,,08/11/2011,,,04/11/2012,,,,,,,,,To OMB,,09/24/2011,,,05/24/2012,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,12/23/2011,,,08/23/2012,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,12/31/2011,,,08/30/2012,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,03/02/2012,,,10/30/2012,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sound for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles,,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Quieter Vehicles Sound Alert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2127-AK93,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: NPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would respond to The Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010, which directs the Secretary of Transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that provides for a means of alerting blind and other pedestrians of motor vehicle operation.

Rollover and loss of control crashes involving heavy vehicles is a serious safety issue that is responsible for 304 fatalities and 2,738 injuries annually. They are also a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions of dollars of lost productivity and excess energy consumption each year. Suppliers and truck and motorcoach manufacturers have developed stability control technology for heavy vehicles to mitigate these types of crashes. Our preliminary estimate produces an effectiveness range of thirty-seven to fifty-six percent against single-vehicle tractor-trailer rollover crashes and three to fourteen percent against  loss of control crashes that result from skidding on the road surface. With these effectiveness estimates, annually, we estimate 29 - 66 lives would be saved, 517 - 979 MAIS 1-5 injuries would be reduced, and 810 - 1,693 crashes that involved property damage only would be eliminated. Additionally, it would save $10 - $26 million in property damage and travel delays. Based on the technology unit costs and affected vehicles, we estimate technology costs would be $55 to 107 million, annually. However, the costs savings from reducing travel delay and property damage would produce net benefits of $128 - $372 million.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economically Significant Major,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 03/18/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,Originally,,,New,,,Actual,,,,,,,,Scheduled Date,,,Projected Date,,,Date,,,,,,To OST,,05/11/2011,,,08/12/2011,,,09/28/2011,,,,,,To OMB,,06/23/2011,,,11/25/2011,,,12/09/2011,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,09/23/2011,,,03/30/2012,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,09/30/2011,,,04/30/2012,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,11/30/2011,,,06/30/2012,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FMVSS No. 218 and Enforcement Policy Concerning Novelty Helmets,,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Novelty Helmets Enforcement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2127-AL01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: NPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Abstract: This rulemaking would establish an enforcement policy regarding novelty motorcycle helmets.

In addition to military and energy activities, the definition of ""national defense"" includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title   VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the protection and restoration of critical infrastructure. Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorization legislation, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practicable, the rules be consistent and unified.
