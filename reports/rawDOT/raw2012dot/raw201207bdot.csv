In August 2007, NHTSA published a motorcoach safety plan identifying four specific priority items: seat belts on motorcoaches, rollover structural integrity, emergency evacuation, and fire safety. The DOT published a comprehensive motorcoach safety action plan in November 2009 that reiterated NHTSA‰Ûªs motorcoach safety priorities. This rulemaking also addresses 6 recommendations issued by the NTSB on motorcoach roof strength and structural integrity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 03/18/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,,New Projected Date,,,,Actual Date,,,,,,To OST,,,08/12/2011,,,,10/28/2011,,,,11/10/2011,,,,,,Returned to Mode,,,,,,,,,,,05/11/2012,,,,,,To OMB,,,09/23/2011,,,,08/16/2012,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,,12/23/2011,,,,11/15/2012,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,,12/30/2011,,,,11/30/2012,,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,,03/02/2012,,,,01/30/2013,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Electronic Stability Control Systems for Heavy Vehicles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Red67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Truck Tractor Electronic Stability Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2127-AK97,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: NPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would promulgate a new Federal standard that would require stability control systems on truck tractors and motorcoaches that address both rollover and loss of control crashes, after an extensive research program to evaluate the available technologies, an evaluation of the costs and benefits, and a review of manufacturerå«s product plans. Rollover and loss of control crashes involving heavy vehicles is a serious safety issue that is responsible for 304 fatalities and 2,738 injuries annually. They are also a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions of dollars of lost productivity and excess energy consumption each year. Suppliers and truck and motorcoach manufacturers have",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,developed stability control technology for heavy vehicles to mitigate these types of crashes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our preliminary estimate produces an effectiveness range of thirty-seven to fifty-six percent against single-vehicle tractor-trailer rollover crashes and three to fourteen percent against  loss of control crashes that result from skidding on the road surface. With these effectiveness estimates, annually, we estimate 29 - 66 lives would be saved, 517 - 979 MAIS 1-5 injuries would be reduced, and 810 - 1,693 crashes that involved property damage only would be eliminated. Additionally, it would save $10 - $26 million in property damage and travel delays. Based on the technology unit costs and affected vehicles, we estimate technology costs would be $55 to 107 million, annually. However, the costs savings from reducing travel delay and property damage would produce net benefits of $128 - $372 million.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economically Significant Major,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federalism Prompting action: None Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 03/18/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,,New Projected Date,,,,Actual Date,,,,,,To OST,,,05/11/2011,,,,08/12/2011,,,,09/28/2011,,,,,,To OMB,,,06/23/2011,,,,11/25/2011,,,,12/09/2011,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,,09/23/2011,,,,03/30/2012,,,,05/04/2012,,,,,,Publication Date,,,09/30/2011,,,,04/30/2012,,,,05/23/2012,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,,11/30/2011,,,,08/21/2012,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: 77 FR 30766,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FMVSS No. 218 and Enforcement Policy Concerning Novelty Helmets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Red68.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Novelty Helmets Enforcement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2127-AL01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: NPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would reduce the sale and use of novelty motorcycle helmets.

The DPA is the Presidentå«s primary authority to ensure timely availability of private sector resources for national defense. In addition to military and energy activities, the definition of ""national defense"" includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title   VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the protection and restoration of critical infrastructure. Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorization legislation, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practicable, the rules be consistent and unified.

The rulemaking responds to several recommendations issued by the National Transportation Safety Board. Last month, this action was listed as an SNPRM, but DOT now intends to harmonize with 2013 ICAO standards in a final rule.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Regulatory Flexibility Act,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: Secretarial/Head of Operating Administration Decision,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 03/26/2009 Docket Number: PHMSA-2009-0095 Dates for Final Rule:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,,Actual Date,,,,,,,,,To OST,08/29/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To OMB,09/19/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,12/18/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,12/28/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hazardous Materials: Combustible Liquids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Red82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Combustible Liquids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2137-AE52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Withdrawal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: ANPRM: Publication Date 04/05/2010; End of Comment Period 07/06/2010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would consider the transportation of combustible liquids and whether the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) should harmonize domestic regulations with international standards.
