FMCSA has consolidated this follow-up to the EOBR rule with the Hours Of Service Of Drivers: Supporting Documents rulemaking for development of a single NPRM in RIN 2126-AB20. In addressing Hours of Service Supporting Documents requirements in this new rulemaking, FMCSA will consider reducing or eliminating current paperwork burdens associated with supporting documents in favor of expanded EOBR use. In addition it will proopose technical standards for an EOBR, address driver harassment issues, and provide clarification and request further comments on several issues. On January 15, 2010, the American Trucking Associations (ATA) filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir. No. 10-1009). ATA petitioned the court to direct FMCSA to issue an NPRM on supporting documents in conformance with the requirements set forth in section 113 of the HMTAA within 60 days after the issuance of the writ and a final rule no later than 6 months after the issuance of the NPRM. The court granted the petition for writ of mandamus on September 30, 2010, ordering FMCSA to issue an NPRM on the supporting document regulations by December 30, 2010. At the request of the agency, the DC Circuit extended the deadline to January 31, 2011. On April 5, 2010, FMCSA issued a related final rule (RIN 2126-AA89) that required the use of EOBRs by motor carriers with significant hours-of-service violations (75 FR 17208). A petition for judicial review was filed with the Seventh Circuit.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has also recommended FMCSA require documentation of bus motor vehicle leases and interchanges based on a crash investigation in 2008 near Victoria, Texas. The rulemaking would determine two things: First, whether any or all of the present practices of motor carriers of passengers, with respect to the performance of transportation by the use of vehicles owned by others, the interchange of vehicles, and the leasing of vehicles to private motor carriers and shippers, should be discontinued because they are contrary to the public interest; and, if any or all of the present practices should be continued.

This rulemaking would respond to requirements of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The statute requires that CAFE standards be prescribed separately for passenger automobiles and non-passenger automobiles to achieve a combined fleet fuel economy of at least 35 mpg by model year 2020. For model years 2021 and beyond, the statute requires that the average fuel economy required to be attained by each fleet of passenger and non-passenger automobiles be the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,maximum feasible for each model year. The law requires the standards be set at least 18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"months prior to the start of the model year. On May 21, 2010, President Obama issued a memorandum directing NHTSA and EPA to conduct a joint rulemaking (NHTSA regulating fuel economy and EPA regulating greenhouse gas emissions), and to issue a Notice of Intent to Issue a Proposed Rule (NOI) by September 30, 2010.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economically Significant Major,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EIS EU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NAFTA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Foreign,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: Final rule: : 04/01/2015 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 05/27/2010 Docket Number: NHTSA-2010-0131 Dates for Final Rule:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,Originally Scheduled Date,,New Projected Date,,Actual Date,,,,,,,,To OST,,07/13/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,To OMB,,07/13/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,08/12/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,08/15/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,10/14/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mandatory Event Data Recorder Requirements (RRR),,,,,,,,,Yellow,,,,,63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Mandatory EDR Requirements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2127-AK86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: NPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would establish a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard to mandate the installation of Event Data Recorders (EDR) in light vehicles. The standard would incorporate the current 49 CFR Part 563, which established the current reporting requirement of voluntarily installed EDRs in light vehicles. Part 563 presently requires vehicle manufacturers who are voluntarily installing EDRs to be in compliance with the regulation by September 1, 2012. This rulemaking would not affect the 2012 compliance date for voluntarily-installed EDRs. Furthermore, this rulemaking would not modify any of the Part 563 data elements, data capture and format requirements, data retrieval specifications, or data survivability and crash test requirements. Moreover, this rulemaking to mandate EDRs across the entire light vehicle fleet could contribute to advancements in vehicle designs, and advanced restraint and other safety countermeasures. The estimated total incremental costs associated with this rulemaking would be $24.4 million (2009 dollars), which is measured from a baseline of 91.6 percent EDR installation to 100 percent installation, assuming the sale of 15.5 million light vehicles per year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 02/22/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,Originally Scheduled Date,,New Projected Date,,Actual Date,,,,,,,,To OST,,06/15/2011,,09/20/2011,,09/13/2011,,,,,,,,To OMB,,07/26/2011,,01/03/2012,,02/01/2012,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,10/25/2011,,05/25/2012,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,10/31/2011,,05/31/2012,,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,12/31/2011,,07/31/2012,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Upgrade of Event Data Recorder Requirements,,,,,,,,,,,Red,,,64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Light Vehicle Upgrade of EDR Requirements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2127-AK87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Undetermined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would expand the utility of the amount and type of data Event Data Recorders (EDRs) capture in light vehicles in the event of a crash. The rulemaking would consider requiring some of the optional data elements specified in 49 CFR Part 563. Part 563 established the current reporting requirement of voluntarily installed EDRs in light vehicles. In addition, this rulemaking would make revisions to the optional data elements to account for the latest advances in vehicle safety. Part 563 presently requires vehicle manufacturers who are voluntarily installing EDRs to be in compliance with the regulation by September 1, 2012. In a separate rulemaking (2127-AK86 Mandatory Part 563 Event Data Recorder Requirements), the agency would propose requiring that all light vehicles comply with the requirements specified in current 49 CFR 563. This rulemaking would seek additional information from the public and expand upon that initiative. Moreover, this rulemaking would contribute to advancements in vehicle designs, advanced restraints and other safety countermeasures. The costs are expected to be minimal since some vehicle manufacturers presently capture additional data beyond Part 563 in their EDRs.

In response, NHTSA requested public comment on the subject and received thousands of comments supporting the petitioner's request. Based on the available safety data and the ancillary benefit of reduced fuel consumption, this rulemaking would consider a new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard that would require the installation of speed limiting devices on heavy trucks. We believe this rule would have minimal cost, as all heavy trucks already have these devices installed, although some vehicles do not have the limit set. This rule would decrease the estimated 8991 fatalities caused by crashes involving heavy trucks and buses. It would also increase the fleet fuel efficiency of these vehicles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economically Significant Major,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 03/18/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,Originally Scheduled Date,,New Projected Date,,Actual Date,,,,,,,,To OST,,08/11/2011,,04/11/2012,,,,,,,,,,To OMB,,09/24/2011,,05/24/2012,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,12/23/2011,,08/23/2012,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,12/31/2011,,08/30/2012,,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,03/02/2012,,10/30/2012,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sound for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles,,,,,,,,,,Green,,,,66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Created by Online2PDF.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Quieter Vehicles Sound Alert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2127-AK93,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: NPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would respond to The Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010, which directs the Secretary of Transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that provides for a means of alerting blind and other pedestrians of motor vehicle operation.
