In addition to military and energy activities, the definition of ""national defense"" includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title   VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the protection and restoration of critical infrastructure. Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorizition, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practacable, the rules be consistent and unifed.

This change complies with a mandate in the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 (PIPES Act). Until 2008, unless a rural low stress pipeline crossed a commercially navigable waterway, a hazardous liquid pipeline operating at low-stress in a rural area was not regulated under Federal pipeline  safety regulations in 49 CFR Part 195. Section four of the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 (PIPES Act), requires PHMSA to ""issue regulations subjecting low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines to the same standards and regulations as other hazardous liquid pipelines."" The Act also provided that the new regulations could be issued in phases. PHMSA decided to implement the PIPES Act mandate in phases, in part because PHMSA did not have complete data on the extent of rural low stress pipelines that would be covered by the statutory mandate. Phase one, published in a final rule on June 3, 2008, applied full Part 195 regulation to the higher-risk, larger-diameter rural low-stress pipelines, i.e., those low-stress pipelines with a diameter of 8 5/8-inches or greater located in or within one-half mile of an unusually sensitive area (USA). These are the rural low stress pipelines that have more potential to cause harm to unusually sensitive areas. In phase two (this rulemaking), we would apply Part 195 safety requirements to all rural low-stress pipelines not included in the phase one rule. Thus, the pipelines addressed by this  rulemaking are those rural low-stress pipelines of any diameter located more than one-half mile from a USA and those less than 8 5/8 inches in diameter located within one-half mile  of a USA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 02/15/2008 Docket Number: PHMSA-2008-0186 Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,Actual Date,,,,,To OST,,,7/19/10,,,,,,,,,,,To OMB,,,8/20/10,,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,,11/18/10,,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,,11/30/10,,,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,,1/31/11,,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hazardous Materials: Bulk Loading and Unloading Operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Red80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Loading/Unloading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2137-AE37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: NPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would request information from industry that would consider whether additional requirements governing bulk loading and unloading operations are necessary.
