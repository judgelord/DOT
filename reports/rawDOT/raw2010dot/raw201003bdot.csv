The recent increase in roadway worker fatalities that have occurred on adjacent track has caused some concern at FRA and throughout the industry, even prompting the filing of a petition for emergency order. FRA issued a notice of safety advisory to address the issue in May of 2004; however, it appears that the effects were not long-lasting. This rulemaking is based on the consensus language developed through the Roadway Worker Protection (RWP) Working Group of FRA«s Railroad Safety Advisory Committee (RSAC).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: Secretarial/Head of Operating Administration Decision,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/20/2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: FRA-2008-0059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dates for Final Rule:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,Actual Date,,,,,To OST,,,04/08/2010,,,,,,,,,,,To OMB,,,05/14/2010,,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,,08/12/2010,,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,,08/26/2010,,,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,,10/25/2010,,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Positive Train Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Red48.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Positive Train Control Implementation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2130-AC03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Final Rule,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 07/21/2009; End of Comment Period 08/20/2009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would regulate the submission of Positive Train Control plans; the implementation of the Positive Train Control Systems; and the qualification, installation, maintenance and use of the these systems required under 49 USC 20157 or specifically required by the Federal Railroad Administration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economically Significant Major,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Regulatory Flexibility Act Prompting action: Statute Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 10/16/2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: FRA-2008-0132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dates for Final Rule:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,Actual Date,,,,,,,To OST,10/13/2009,,,,,,10/09/2009,,,,,,,To OMB,10/16/2009,,,,,,10/21/2009,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,10/26/2009,,,12/04/2009,,,12/30/2009,,,,,,,Publication Date,10/30/2009,,,01/15/2010,,,01/15/2010,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Unanticipated issues requiring further analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: 75 FR 2598,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alcohol and Controlled Substance Testing for Maintenance-of-Way Employees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Red49.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Controlled Substance Testing/Maintenance Employees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2130-AC10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: NPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would revise the Federal Railroad Administration«s alcohol and drug regulations to cover all employees of railroads, railroad contractors, and subcontractors who perform maintenance-of-way activities.

The requirement would be an occupant containment requirement on the amount of allowable excursion through passenger vehicle side windows. The SAFETEA-LU legislation requires that: ""[t]he Secretary shall also initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish performance standards to reduce complete and partial ejections of vehicle occupants from outboard seating positions. In formulating the   standards the Secretary shall consider various ejection mitigation systems. The Secretary shall issue a final rule under this paragraph no later than October 1, 2009."" The SAFETEA-LU legislation also requires that, if the Secretary determines that the subject final rule deadline cannot be met, the Secretary shall notify and provide an explanation to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce of the delay. On September 24, 2009, the Secretary provided appropriate notification to Congress that the final rule will be delayed until January 31, 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economically Significant Major,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unfunded Mandate EU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NAFTA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Foreign,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: Final Rule : 10/01/2009 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/10/2005 Docket Number: NHTSA-2009-0183,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dates for Final Rule:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,Actual Date,,,,,,,To OST,09/17/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,To OMB,10/29/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,01/28/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,01/31/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 111, Rearview Mirrors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Red57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Rearview Mirrors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2127-AK43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: NPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: ANPRM: Publication Date 03/04/09; End of Comment Period 05/04/09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would amend Federal Motor Vehicle Standard No. 111; Rearview Mirrors, to reflect requirements contained in the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007.

The DPA is the President«s primary authority to ensure timely availability of private sector resources for national defense. In addition to military and energy activities, the definition of ""national defense"" includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the protection and restoration of critical infrastructure. Under Title I of the DPA, the President has the authority to require the acceptance and prioritization of contracts and orders -- and to allocate materials, services, and facilities -- in support of the national defense. Under Section 201 of Executive Order 12919, the President has delegated these prioritization and allocation authorities to the Secretary of Transportation for all forms of civil transportation. In the 2009 DPA reauthorizition, Congress mandated that each Federal agency with delegated authority under Title I of the DPA develop final rules that establish standards and procedures for implementing its delegated authority in emergency and nonemergency conditons. Additionally, Congress mandated that, to the extent practacable, the rules be consistent and unifed. DOT is part of an interageny working group, along with the other delegated agencies, that is developing consistent unifed rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Information Collection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: Final rule : 06/27/2010 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/07/2009 Docket Number:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,Actual Date,,,,,To OST,,,01/09/2009,,,02/16/2010,,,,,,,,To OMB,,,02/01/2009,,,03/16/2010,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,,03/01/2009,,,04/16/2010,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,,03/01/2009,,,04/26/2010,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,,05/01/2009,,,05/26/2010,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections - Part 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Aviation Consumer Part 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2105-AD92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: NPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Abstract: This rulemaking would enhance airline passenger protections by addressing the following areas:(1) contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays; (2) reporting of tarmac delay data; (3) customer service plans; (4) notification to passengers of flight status changes; (5) inflation adjustment for denied boarding compensation;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(6) alternative transportation for passengers on canceled flights; (7) opt-out provisions (e.g. travel insurance);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(8) contract of carriage provisions; (9) baggage fees disclosure; and (10) full fare advertising.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Regulatory Flexibility Act,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 07/01/2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,Actual Date,,,,,To OST,,,02/10/2010,,,03/16/2010,,,,,,,,To OMB,,,02/26/2010,,,03/30/2010,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,,05/26/2010,,,05/26/2010,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,,06/01/2010,,,06/01/2010,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,,08/01/2010,,,08/01/2010,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Carrier-Supplied Medical Oxygen, Service Animals, and Accessibility of Carrier Websites, Kiosks, and In-Flight Entertainment Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: ACAA SNPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2105-AD96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: SNPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage:None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Abstract: This rulemaking would fulfill a commitment made in the final rule amending the Air Carrier Access Act rules to develop an SNPRM seeking information from the public on: (1) the cost and technical issues involved in requiring carrier website accessibility; (2) whether automated kiosks operated by carriers in airports and elsewhere should be required to be accessible; (3) whether there are safety-related reasons for excluding service animals other than dogs that may be specific to foreign carriers; (4) whether the cost of requiring carriers to supply free in-flight medical oxygen would create an undue burden; and (5) whether providing high-contrast captioning on in-flight entertainment displays is technically and economically feasible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 09/15/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: Dates for SNPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,Actual Date,,,,,To OST,,,08/12/2010,,,,,,,,,,,To OMB,,,09/01/2010,,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,,12/01/2010,,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,,12/10/2010,,,,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,,03/10/2011,,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for SNPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,68.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hazardous Materials: Requirements for Storage of Explosives During Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RedPopular Title: Storage of Explosives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2137-AE06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: NPRM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: ANPRM: Publication Date 11/16/2005; End of Comment Period 02/14/2006; Reopening of Comment Period 7/03/2008; End of Reopened Comment Period 10/01/2008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking would address the current safety and security risks associated with the storage of explosives during transportation. The Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) require shipments stored during transportation to conform to the same requirements that apply when the shipments are actually moving and for the shipping company to have security plans covering its shipments. Otherwise, the HMR do not include   specific requirements for facilities at which explosives or other high-hazard materials are stored during transportation. The HMR do not establish specific standards for storage facilities nor do they limit the amount of material that may be stored in a single location. Through this rulemaking, the agency will evaluate the adequacy of existing regulations and the need for additional, more specific requirements. In particular, the agency is considering whether current industry standards applicable to the storage of explosives should be incorporated by reference into the HMR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/01/2005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Docket Number: PHMSA-2005-22987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,Actual Date,,,,,To OST,,,02/02/2007,,,04/09/2010,,,,,,,,To OMB,,,03/09/2007,,,05/13/2010,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,,06/07/2007,,,08/11/2010,,,,,,,,Publication Date,,,06/14/2007,,,08/26/2010,,,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,,08/17/2007,,,10/25/2010,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hazardous Materials: Enforcement Regulations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Red69.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Package Inspection Authority,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2137-AE13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Final Rule,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 10/02/2008;End of Comment Period 12/01/2008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: Pursuant to a mandate in SAFETEA-LU (section 7118 of P.L. 109-59), this rulemaking would establish procedural regulations to implement authority provided to DOT to open packages believed to contain hazardous materials; remove such packages from transportation; gather information; order the package transported to a facility for examination and analysis; obtain assistance from qualified persons; and issue emergency restrictions, prohibitions, recalls, or out-of-service orders to abate an imminent hazard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EU NAFTA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Foreign,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: Temporary Rule : 10/11/2005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Rule : 08/10/2006 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/10/2005 Docket Number: PHMSA-2005-22356,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dates for Final Rule:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,Originally Scheduled Date,,,New Projected Date,,,Actual Date,,,,,,,To OST,12/22/2009,,,04/23/2010,,,,,,,,,,To OMB,01/26/2010,,,05/27/2010,,,,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,04/26/2010,,,08/27/2010,,,,,,,,,,Publication Date,05/01/2010,,,09/07/2010,,,,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hazardous Materials: Risk-Based Adjustment of Transportation Security Plan Requirements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Red70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Security Plans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2137-AE22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Final Rule,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 9/8/2008; End of Comment Period 11/10/2008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: In response to two industry petitions for rulemaking, this rulemaking will reconsider and refine the list of hazardous materials for which security plans are currently required.
