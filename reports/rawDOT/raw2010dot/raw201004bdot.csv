The Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) require shipments stored during transportation to conform to the same requirements that apply when the shipments are actually moving and for the shipping company to have security plans covering its shipments. Otherwise, the HMR do not include specific requirements for facilities at which explosives or other high-hazard materials are stored during transportation. The HMR do not establish specific standards for storage facilities nor do they limit the amount of material that may be stored in a single location. Through this rulemaking, the agency will evaluate the adequacy of existing regulations and the need for additional, more specific requirements. In particular, the agency is considering whether current industry standards applicable to the storage of explosives should be incorporated by reference into the HMR.",,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: None,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,,,,,,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/01/2005 Docket Number: PHMSA-2005-22987 Dates for NPRM:,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,,Originally Scheduled Date,,New Projected Date,,Actual Date,,,,To OST,,2/2/07,,4/9/10,,,,,,To OMB,,3/9/07,,5/13/10,,,,,,OMB Clearance,,6/7/07,,8/11/10,,,,,,Publication Date,,6/14/07,,8/26/10,,,,,,End of Comment Period,,8/17/07,,10/25/10,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,Hazardous Materials: Enforcement Regulations,,,,,,,,,,Red71,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Package Inspection Authority,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2137-AE13,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Final Rule,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 10/02/2008;End of Comment Period 12/01/2008.,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: Pursuant to a mandate in SAFETEA-LU (section 7118 of P.L. 109-59), this rulemaking would establish procedural regulations to implement authority provided to DOT to open packages believed to contain hazardous materials; remove such packages from transportation; gather information; order the package transported to a facility for examination and analysis; obtain assistance from qualified persons; and issue emergency restrictions, prohibitions, recalls, or out-of-service orders to abate an imminent hazard.",,,,,,,,,,Effects:,,,,,,,,,,EU NAFTA,,,,,,,,,,Foreign,,,,,,,,,,Prompting action: Statute,,,,,,,,,,Legal Deadline: Temporary Rule : 10/11/2005,,,,,,,,,,Final Rule : 08/10/2006 Rulemaking Project Initiated: 08/10/2005 Docket Number: PHMSA-2005-22356,,,,,,,,,,Dates for Final Rule:,,,,,,,,,,Milestone,Originally Scheduled Date,,New Projected Date,,Actual Date,,,,,To OST,12/22/09,,4/23/10,,,,,,,To OMB,1/26/10,,5/27/10,,,,,,,OMB Clearance,4/26/10,,8/27/10,,,,,,,Publication Date,5/1/10,,9/7/10,,,,,,,Explanation for any delay: Additional coordination necessary,,,,,,,,,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None,,,,,,,,,,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,Hazardous Materials: Risk-Based Adjustment of Transportation Security Plan Requirements,,,,,,,,,,Red72,,,,,,,,,,Popular Title: Security Plans,,,,,,,,,,RIN 2137-AE22,,,,,,,,,,Stage: Final Rule,,,,,,,,,,Previous Stage: NPRM: Publication Date 9/8/2008; End of Comment Period 11/10/2008.,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: In response to two industry petitions for rulemaking, this rulemaking will reconsider and refine the list of hazardous materials for which security plans are currently required.
