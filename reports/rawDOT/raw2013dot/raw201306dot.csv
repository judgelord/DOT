This rulemaking pertains to the new categorical exclusions; FHWA and FTA are proposing to add CEs to its environmental regulations (23 CFR 771) in order to comply with MAP-21, as well as to improve the efficiency of the environmental review process. The additional CEs make the least intensive form of review available for those actions that typically do not have the potential for significant environmental effects, and, therefore, do not merit additional analysis and documentation associated with an environmental assessment (EA) or an environmental impact statement (EIS). This provision also allows for the transfer of some existing CEs from subsection (d) of 23 CFR 771.117 to subsection (c) of that section.

Rollover and loss of control crashes involving heavy vehicles is a serious safety issue that is responsible for 304 fatalities and 2,738 injuries annually. They are also a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions of dollars of lost productivity and excess energy consumption each year. Suppliers and truck and motorcoach manufacturers have developed stability control technology for heavy vehicles to mitigate these types of crashes. Our preliminary estimate produces an effectiveness range of thirty-seven to fifty-six percent against single-vehicle tractor-trailer rollover crashes and three to fourteen percent against loss of control crashes that result from skidding on the road surface. With these effectiveness estimates, annually, we estimate 29 - 66 lives would be saved, 517 - 979 MAIS 1-5 injuries would be reduced, and 810 - 1,693 crashes that involved property damage only would be eliminated. Additionally, it would save $10 - $26 million in property damage and travel delays. Based on the technology unit costs and affected vehicles, we estimate technology costs would be $55 to 107 million, annually. However, the costs savings from reducing travel delay and property damage would produce net benefits of $128 - $372 million.

Under the existing regulatory definition of motorcycle in Part 571.3, three-wheeled motor vehicles are classified as motorcycles. This is appropriate for motorcycles with sidecars, trikes, and other three-wheeled vehicles that are based on a motorcycle-like configuration. However, other three-wheeled vehicles have passenger-car characteristics such as fully enclosed cabins, hinged doors with roll-up windows, steering wheels, and side-by-side seating. Because these car-like vehicles ride on three wheels instead of four, they are not required to meet federal safety standards for passenger cars (although they are subject to motorcycle safety standards.) Various car-like three-wheeled vehicle models have been imported into the U.S. and have been available for sale to the public.

This rulemaking would be responsive to two petitions for rulemaking submitted by industry representatives, requesting this action. Developing requirements for the HMR would provide wider access to the regulatory flexibility currently only offered by special permit and competent authorities. The HMR would authorize the transportation of certain explosives, ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate emulsions, and other specific hazardous materials in bulk packagings, which are not otherwise authorized under the HMR. These hazardous materials are used in blasting operations on specialized vehicles, multi-purpose bulk trucks (MBTs). MBTs are used as mobile work platforms to create blends of explosives that are unique for each blast site.
