Without increased awareness and knowledge of the statutory and regulatory requirements for safe operation, the risk of unsafe UAS operations will only rise. Aircraft registration, identification, and marking will assist the Department in identifying owners of UAS that are operated in an unsafe manner, so we may continue to educate these users, and when appropriate, take enforcement action.

However, other three-wheeled vehicles have passenger-car characteristics such as fully enclosed cabins, hinged doors with roll-up windows, steering wheels, and side-by-side seating. Because these car-like vehicles ride on three wheels instead of four, they are not required to meet federal safety standards for passenger cars (although they are subject to motorcycle safety standards.)

The statute requires that NHTSA establish a medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicle and work truck fuel efficiency improvement program that achieves the maximum feasible improvement, including standards that are appropriate, cost-effective, and technologically feasible. The law requires that the new standards provide at least 4 full model years of regulatory lead-time and 3 full model years of regulatory stability (i.e., the standards must remain in effect for 3 years before they may be amended). This action would follow the first ever Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles ("Phase 1") (76 FR 57106, September 15, 2011).

In February 2014, the President directed DOT and EPA to complete the second phase of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles during his second term.""bstract: This rulemaking would address fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work trucks for model years beyond 2018.

Shortly after the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act was passed, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued its accident investigation report on the Marshall, Michigan accident.

These amendments would: (1) prohibit the transport of lithium ion cells and batteries as cargo aboard passenger carrying aircraft; (2) limit lithium ion cells and batteries to a 30 percent state of charge; and (3) limit the number of packages that may be offered under current provisions for small (excepted) cells and batteries to not more than one package per consignment. We anticipate these amendments will result in temporary supply chain disruptions but will produce immediate safety benefits by eliminating vulnerability in the existing transport regulations.,,,Effects:,,,,Foreign,,Prompting action: None,,,Legal Deadline: None,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/25/2016,,,Docket Number: PHMSA-2016-0014,,,Dates for Interim Final Rule:,,,Milestone,Originally,New,Actual,Scheduled,Projected,Date,Date,Date,To OST ,,06/02/2016 ,06/14/2016 To OMB ,,08/19/2016 ,08/17/2016 OMB Clearance ,,11/17/2016 ,Publication Date ,11/01/2016 ,11/28/2016 ,End of Comment Period ,11/30/2016 ,12/28/2016 ,Explanation for any delay:,N/A ,,Federal Register Citation for Interim Final Rule: None,,,,,,,,,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,,,87. ,,Hazardous Materials: FAST Act Requirements for Real-Time Train Consist Information,BlackPopular Title: OHMS: FAST Act for Real-Time Train Consist Info,,,RIN 2137-AF21,,,Stage: NPRM,,,Previous Stage: N/A,,,"Abstract: In accordance with the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), PHMSA, in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies, will issue regulations that require Class I railroads transporting hazardous materials to generate real-time, electronic train consist information, to include: (1) the identity, quantity, and location of hazardous materials on a train; (2) the point of origin and destination of the train; (3) emergency response information required by the hazardous materials regulations; and (4) an emergency response point of contact designated by the Class I railroad. Each railroad must enter into an agreement with each applicable state and local entities (e.g., fusion centers) to provide them with secure and confidential access to the electronic information for each train transporting hazardous materials in the jurisdiction of the entity for purposes of sharing with State and local first responders, emergency response officials, and law enforcement personnel that are involved in emergency response activities.",,,Effects:,,,,Foreign,,Prompting action: Statute,,,Legal Deadline: ,Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (§7302) : 12/04/2016,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/25/2016,,,Docket Number: PHMSA-2016-0015,,,Dates for NPRM:,,,Milestone,Originally,New,Actual,Scheduled,Projected,Date,Date,Date,To OST ,,10/18/2016 ,To OMB ,,11/29/2016 ,OMB Clearance ,,02/28/2017 ,Publication Date ,07/26/2016 ,03/10/2017 ,End of Comment Period ,09/26/2016 ,05/10/2017 ,Explanation for any delay:,N/A ,,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,,,88. ,,Pipeline Safety: Underground Storage Facilities for Natural Gas,BlackPopular Title: OPS: Underground Storage Facilities Natural Gas,,,RIN 2137-AF22,,,Stage: Interim Final Rule,,,Previous Stage: N/A,,,"Abstract: PHMSA has safety authority over the underground storage facilities used in natural gas pipeline transportation, but has no safety regulations in the DOT Code (49 CFR Part 192) that apply to the down-hole underground storage reservoir for natural gas.
