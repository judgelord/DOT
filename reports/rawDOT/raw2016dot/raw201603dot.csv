Without increased awareness and knowledge of the statutory and regulatory requirements for safe operation, the risk of unsafe UAS operations will only rise. Aircraft registration, identification, and marking will assist the Department in identifying owners of UAS that are operated in an unsafe manner, so we may continue to educate these users, and when appropriate, take enforcement action.

In completing the report Congress required under section 32104 of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), FMCSA has determined that the current financial responsibility minimums are inadequate to fully cover the costs of some crashes in light of increased medical costs and DOT«s revised value of statistical life estimates. The FMCSA is also considering proposing to extend the financial responsibility requirements to private motor carriers, as authorized by section 4120 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU).

Under the existing regulatory definition of motorcycle in Part 571.3, three-wheeled motor vehicles are classified as motorcycles. This is appropriate for motorcycles with sidecars, trikes, and other three-wheeled vehicles that are based on a motorcycle-like configuration. However, other three-wheeled vehicles have passenger-car characteristics such as fully enclosed cabins, hinged doors with roll-up windows, steering wheels, and side-by-side seating. Because these car-like vehicles ride on three wheels instead of four, they are not required to meet federal safety standards for passenger cars (although they are subject to motorcycle safety standards.) Various car-like three-wheeled vehicle models have been imported into the U.S. and have been available for sale to the public.

Using the principals set forth in E.O. 13563, FRA has reviewed the regulations in Part 174 and other relevant sections of the HMR, and identified regulations that are outdated, unclear, no longer necessary, may present an undue economic burden on the regulated community, conflict with other North American standards and regulations, or do not sufficiently address technological advancements in the railroad operating environment. Further, FRA has identified several trends in industry practices and operating procedures that present new and different risks to safety that should be addressed in Part 174 of the HMR. This rulemaking would more fully align the HMR with the results of the FRA review and would update, clarify, correct and provide relief of certain regulatory requirements applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials by rail.",,,Effects:,,,,None ,,Prompting action: None,,,Legal Deadline:ÊNone,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 03/03/2014,,,Docket Number: PHMSA-2014-0031,,,Dates for NPRM:,,,Milestone,Originally,New,Actual,Scheduled,Projected,Date,Date,Date,To OST ,10/20/2014Ê,06/29/2016Ê,To OMB ,11/19/2014Ê,08/12/2016Ê,OMB Clearance ,02/17/2015Ê,11/11/2016Ê,Publication Date ,02/25/2015Ê,11/21/2016Ê,End of Comment Period ,05/25/2015Ê,01/20/2017Ê,Explanation for any delay:,Additional coordination necessary,,,"Other, higher priorities",,Federal Register Citation for NPRM: None,,,,,,,,,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,,,87.Ê,,Hazardous Materials: Oil Spill Response Plans and Information Sharing for High-Hazard Flammable Trains,BlackPopular Title: Oil Spill Response Plans and Info Sharing for HHFT,,,RIN 2137-AF08,,,Stage: NPRM,,,Previous Stage: ANPRM published 8/1/2014; C/P closed 9/30/2014.,,,"Abstract: This rulemaking, developed in consultation with the Federal Railroad Administration, would revise PHMSA's regulations to expand the applicability of comprehensive oil spill response plans (OSRPs) based on thresholds of liquid petroleum oil that apply to an entire train. We are also proposing to revise the format and clarify requirements of a comprehensive OSRP and to require railroads to share information about high-hazard flammable train operations with state and tribal emergency response organizations (i.e., State Emergency Response Commissions and Tribal Emergency Response Commissions) to improve community preparedness.

Specifically, the FAST Act mandates a new phase-out schedule for DOT-111 specification tank cars, including DOT-111 tank cars constructed to the Casualty Prevention Circular (CPC) 1232 (CPC-1232) industry standard, used to transport unrefined petroleum products (e.g., petroleum crude oil), ethanol, and other Class 3 flammable liquids, irrespective of train composition. In addition, the FAST Act mandates that each tank car built to meet the DOT-117 specification, and each non-jacketed tank car retrofit to meet the DOT-117R specification, be equipped with an insulating blanket with at least -inch-thick material. Moreover, the FAST Act specifies minimum top fittings protection requirements for tank cars retrofit to meet the DOT-117R specification. Because the actions taken in this final rule address congressional mandates that instruct the Secretary to issue conforming regulatory amendments immediately or soon after the FAST Act's date of enactment, PHMSA finds that due and timely execution of agency functions would be impeded by the procedures of public notice that are normally required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Therefore, PHMSA finds that public notice is impracticable and that good cause exists to amend the regulations without advance notice and opportunity for public comment.",,,Effects:,,,,None ,,Prompting action: Statute,,,Legal Deadline:ÊNone,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/11/2016,,,Docket Number: PHMSA-2016-0011,,,Dates for Final Rule:,,,Milestone,Originally,New,Actual,Scheduled,Projected,Date,Date,Date,To OST ,05/13/2016Ê,,To OMB ,06/27/2016Ê,,OMB Clearance ,09/26/2016Ê,,Publication Date ,10/07/2016Ê,,Explanation for any delay:,N/A ,,Federal Register Citation for Final Rule: None,,,,,,,,,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,,,89.Ê,,Hazardous Materials: Revised Lithium Battery Provisions,BlackPopular Title: Revised Lithium Battery Provisions,,,RIN 2137-AF20,,,Stage: Interim Final Rule,,,Previous Stage: N/A,,,Abstract: This action would amend the Hazardous Materials Regulations to incorporate three amendments that impact the transport regulations for packaged lithium cells and batteries (i.e. not packed with or contained in equipment). These amendments would: (1) prohibit the transport of lithium ion cells and batteries as cargo aboard passenger carrying aircraft; (2) limit lithium ion cells and batteries to a 30 percent state of charge; and (3) limit the number of packages that may be offered under current provisions for small (excepted) cells and batteries to not more than one package per consignment. We anticipate these amendments will result in temporary supply chain disruptions but will produce immediate safety benefits by eliminating vulnerability in the existing transport regulations.,,,Effects:,,,,Foreign,,Prompting action: None,,,Legal Deadline:ÊNone,,,Rulemaking Project Initiated: 01/25/2016,,,Docket Number: PHMSA-2016-0014,,,Dates for Interim Final Rule:,,,Milestone,Originally,New,Actual,Scheduled,Projected,Date,Date,Date,To OST ,,08/16/2016Ê,To OMB ,,09/30/2016Ê,OMB Clearance ,,12/30/2016Ê,Publication Date ,11/01/2016Ê,01/12/2017Ê,End of Comment Period ,11/30/2016Ê,03/13/2017Ê,Explanation for any delay:,N/A ,,Federal Register Citation for Interim Final Rule: None,,,
