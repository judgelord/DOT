# Abstract

Administrative rulemaking is often presented as a straightforward translation of legislative delegations into agency rules, where bureaucrats adopt their most preferred policy given their constraints, often speeding up or slowing down the policy process to do so. The rulemaking process is indeed highly formulaic, requiring publication of a draft, external review, and public comment before a final rule is published. However, much of the politics of rulemaking may play out in the less formal and transparent process before a draft policy is published. In this stage, different priorities and constraints may drive decisions about which draft policies are published and when.

Theories of policymaking suggest that the politics of rulemaking may differ significantly in the pre-proposal stage. Yet, this part of the policy process has largely eluded quantitative study due to a lack of systematic data. This paper begins to fill this gap. We introduce a new dataset based on thousands of monthly internal project status reports by the U.S. Department of Transportation that allow us to track a rulemaking effort from its origin date through its finalization.  Additionally, we develop several novel measures of prioritization and constraints that we measure both before and after a draft rule is made public,  including the degree of agency resource constraints, internal agency prioritization, changes in sub-agency political appointees, congressional and presidential attention, and the threat of litigation and sanction by courts.

Using these new data and measures, we model the drivers of prioritization and constraint as a multi-stage policy process and identify different political forces at work in each stage. Specifically, we use a multi-stage duration model to test factors that may affect the timing of rules being proposed or finalized thus identify predictors of prioritization and delay. Previous research suggests that that greater internal agency resources—in terms of personnel and budgets—will speed up rulemaking during the largely opaque pre-proposal stage, while attention from external actors, including Congress and the president, will speed up rulemaking during the more transparent notice and comment period. Our data and measures allow new tests of these theories. We show that resources, complexity, and salience have different effects on the speed of rule-writing across different stages.

Our findings hold important implications for our understanding of transparency and bureaucratic policymaking within a representative democracy.

### Summary Stats

We have initiation dates for `r length(unique(dotRIN$RIN))` unique RINs. Of these, `r sum(dotRIN$color == "Red", na.rm = T)` were marked 'delayed,'`r sum(dotRIN$color == "Yellow", na.rm = T)` were marked 'potentially delayed,' and `r sum(dotRIN$color == "Green", na.rm = T)` were marked 'on time' at the time they were last observed. However, DOT increasingly marks projects as 'not on a schedule' (`r sum(dotRIN$color == "Black", na.rm = T)` RINs were last observed in the “Black” category). `r dim(filter(dotMonthly, delayedever == T, !is.na(DOTdate)) %>% select(RIN) %>% distinct())[1]` projects were delayed at some point and `r sum(!is.na(dotRIN$whydelay))` of these give a reason for delay.

`r sum(dotRIN$initiated > as.Date("2008-01-01"), na.rm = T)` RINs were initiated after 2008. `r sum(grepl("Final Rule", dotRIN$STAGE), na.rm = T)` made it to the post-NPRM stage, `r sum(dotStage$STAGE == "Withdrawal", na.rm =T)` have been withdrawn, and `r sum(dotStage$STAGE == "Termination", na.rm =T)` were terminated.



This table shows the average number of months after initiation at which certian milestones are reached:

|Final Rule         |`r round(mean(dotStage$DaysUntilOSTFinalRule, na.rm = T)/30)` |`r round(mean(dotStage$DaysUntilOMBFinalRule, na.rm = T)/30)` | `r round(mean(dotStage$DaysUntilFinalRule, na.rm = T)/30)`| n = `r sum(grepl("Final Rule", dotRIN$STAGE), na.rm = T)`|
|Withdrawal         |`r round(mean(dotStage$DaysUntilOSTWithdrawal, na.rm = T)/30)` |`r round(mean(dotStage$DaysUntilOMBWithdrawal, na.rm = T)/30)` | `r round(mean(dotStage$DaysUntilWithdrawal, na.rm = T)/30)`| n = `r sum(dotStage$STAGE == "Withdrawal", na.rm =T)`|

### Missing data

We have final outcomes for `r nrow(dotRIN %>% filter(!is.na(enddate) ))` RINs, `r nrow(dotRIN %>% filter(DOTdate == lastreport))` RINs were in progress as of `r lastreport`,  and `r nrow(d)` rules dropped out with unknown outcomes [[download .csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/judgelord/DOT/master/data/Unknown_EndDates.csv)], including these:

```{r}
kable(d %>% select(RIN, DOTdate, docket, fedreg)%>% top_n(5)) 
```

We have `r nrow(IFRs)` IFRs without Final Rules [[download .csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/judgelord/DOT/master/data/IFRs_without_finals.csv)]

```{r}

- 2127-AK61 and [2127-AK54](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/fmvss/CARS_Amendment_1.pdf) appear to be notices and ammendments to the 2127-AK53, [NHTSA-2009-0120](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2009/07/29/E9-17994/requirements-and-procedures-for-consumer-assistance-to-recycle-and-save-program) final rule published on 07/29/2009. "This rulemaking is economically significant" but "The rule is being issued without first providing a notice and an opportunity for public comment. As noted above, the Act provides that the rule shall be issued within 30 days after enactment, “notwithstanding” the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553, the Federal law requiring notice and comment. Further, given that schedule and the necessity of quickly beginning to implement this 4-month program with a statutorily fixed end date, the agency finds for good cause that providing notice and comment is impracticable and contrary to the public interest."--"Although there was not time to provide notice and an opportunity to comment prior to issuance of this final rule, NHTSA did engage in extensive outreach prior to its issuance with representatives of those entities most knowledgeable about the subject matter."

The final rule amends FMCSA's regulations to make them consistent with section 4136 of SAFETEA-LU, a provision which makes the FMCSRs applicable to the operation of 9- to 15-passenger vehicles when such vehicles are operated for direct compensation, in interstate commerce, regardless of the distance traveled. Because the statutory language does not provide FMCSA any discretion in adopting the necessary changes to its regulations, FMCSA finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) that prior notice and comment on this final rule is unnecessary."

### Combining data sources

Adding DOT Internal Status Reports to OIRA and Unified Agenda Reports gives a richer picture of rulemaking. Data by RIN, date, and source:
```{r timeline, fig.height = 17}
# If project is ongoing, define enddate as date last observed (for plotting active project status)
dotMonthly %<>% mutate(end = if_else( is.na(enddate), reportdate, enddate) )

        strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0),
        strip.background = element_blank(),

```

Notice how the DOT (esp. FTA and FHA) initiated a large number of projects shortly after Obama's reelection, probably waiting for assurance that they would be able to complete their work.

# Models

Given these questions and the time-series nature of our data (monthly status reports with changing covariate values), we use duration models. Because we are interested in how policies may move through multiple stages of the policymaking process, we use a multi-state model. Doing so allows us to simultaneously model how different factors may affect a policy at different stages (i.e. states), while also modeling a common frailty. We could model each stage separately, but this would ignore correlation within rules across stages. 

Two interpretable statistics address each of our main questions. 

First, we estimate "transition probabilities" (i.e. the probability that a policy will advance to each possible future state at a given time) using the Aalen-Johansen estimator and the cumulative incidence function (the function estimating the number of observations that have transitioned to and from each state over time). 

Second, we estimate the probability that a given transition will occur in a given time window using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Covariates may increase or decrease the likelihood that a given transition will occur, thus increasing or decreasing the estimated rate of advancing from a given stage to a given stage in the policymaking process, and thus the Kaplan-Meier estimate that a given transition will occur after a given date.

## Covariates

[Google spreadsheet of variables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CptLu6Xz7K14KF8PyELsiy-siYZHpi5jjmS9hMyO1xM/edit?usp=sharing)

Some are measured at the rule level, others at the agency level, and others for all rules at a given point in time. Many vary by month or year. We will include a frailty by rule and may need cluster standard errors by rule or agency depending on the covariates.

Many covariates may be correlated and we really should be modeling them as indicators of the latent factors that affect policymaking. For example, observed covariates may be grouped into broader, more discrete concepts like the resources the agency has, the technical complexity of the rule, and the political contentiousness of the rule.

##### Resources 
Resources measures:

- sub-agency budget? - can we get the budget for rulemaking activities? Is this different than estimating SES? 

- "lack of resources" or "lack of staffing" claimed [0,1], a subset of delayed rules

- number of SES / # of rules per year (ideally at sub-agency level if we have SES data for that)

- secretary prompt [0,1] - how many missing? 

- Non-acting subagency head [0,1]

- Same president as initiation date [0,1]

- Same secretary as initiation date [0,1]

- Same subagency head as initiation date [0,1]

##### Complexity  

Complexity measurements:

- "coordination necessary" claimed [0,1], subset of delayed rules

- “unanticipated issues/impacts requiring further analysis”*“awaiting development of additional data” claimed [0,1], a subset of delayed rules

- the score of the abstract on Benoit's political sophistication/complexity

- second comment period [1,0] (though this may also be a measure of external, interest group constraint) 

- the number of comments? (to me this is more about salience and contentiousness than complexity)

- MORE MEASURES? 

##### Contentiousness: 
 White House and Secretary alignment measures:
 
- "other, higher priorities" claimed [0,1] (is it right to interpret this way? Priority could also be internal...which would make it, what? Not a resource per se)

- initiated under same president [0,1] (same party president? we have a few started under Clinton, finished under Obama) 

- went to Secretary twice [0,1]

- days between going to secretary going to ORIA (average if multiple times)

- went to ORIA twice [0,1]

- Did ORIA make changes [0,1]

- days between going to ORIA and publication (count days from the first or last time at ORIA? )

Congress alignment measures:

- positive-negative sentiment words in subcommittee budget report

- positive-negative sentiment words in the subcommittee hearing

- legislative deadline exists [0,1]

- legislative deadline past [0,1]

- prompting action is legislation [0,1] (speeds up rulemaking?)

- legislation is pending [0,1] (slows rulemaking)

- Reg flex required [0,1] slowing? 

- unified congress 

Litigation threat:

- court deadline exists [0,1]

- court deadline past [0,1]

- number of lawsuits against the subagency in the past x years

- avg number of lawsuits against the agency per year of administration (this is perhaps better suited for a model that is not just DOT)

- litigation threatened in comments? [0,1]

## Congressional attention/opposition: 

Below are examples of positive and negative sentiment about the FAA from the 2018 appropriations subcommittee report. Much it is very neutral, but it is fair to say that this actually reflects neutral attitudes. Sentiment analysis allows us to tally up the positive and negative words for each subagency. Other scholars have measured the length of the section on each subagency, but this mostly just reflects the size and diversity of its budget.

#### Examples:

POSITIVE: 

The Committee is encouraged 
by the additional measures the FAA is taking to enhance 
outreach to communities affected by new flightpaths. The 
Committee recommendation includes an additional $2,000,000 to 
support the FAA's ongoing efforts to address community noise 
concerns.
The Committee supports 
research that is being conducted through the FAA's Center of 
Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuel and Environment, the 
Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT) on the impact of 
aviation noise on both sleep and cardiovascular health.
The Committee commends the FAA Office 
of Commercial Space Transportation's efforts to promote private 
sector lunar exploration and development and encourages the FAA 
to explicitly define non-interference and to enhance its 
payload review process to provide companies planning private 
sector lunar development with the security and predictability 
necessary to support substantial investments. 

NEGATIVE:

The Committee is concerned by the FAA's decision to extend by five years its aging Mission Support Network, a 
decision which carries both technology and cost implications.
