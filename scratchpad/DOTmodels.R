# Here we take event data with rows indexed by ID and columns for relevent dates and covariates.
# The method takes date variables, melts the data to identify the order in which various transitions occur, and, finally, models transitions in and out of each stage as a multi-state survival model. 
# THis is a slightly more generic approach than the mstate package vinettes as it does not require one to specifiy which transitions are possible or actually present in the data. Instead, the transition matrix is derived from the data.
# It also attempts to keep data in a tidy format (rather than special class objects). 

# First we identify the order in which events occured in order to identify different types of transitions. 

# STEP 1: IDENTIFY TRANSITIONS AND DATES 

# These data start as one observation per ID (in this case, "RIN")
# Every observation must have a start date (here the date the rulemaking project was "initiated").
