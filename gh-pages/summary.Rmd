# Abstract

Administrative rulemaking is often presented as a straightforward translation of legislative delegations into agency rules, where bureaucrats adopt their most preferred policy given their constraints, often speeding up or slowing down the policy process to do so. The rulemaking process is indeed highly formulaic, requiring publication of a draft, external review, and public comment before a final rule is published. However, much of the politics of rulemaking may play out in the less formal and transparent process before a draft policy is published. In this stage, different priorities and constraints may drive decisions about which draft policies are published and when.

Theories of policymaking suggest that the politics of rulemaking may differ significantly in the pre-proposal stage. Yet, this part of the policy process has largely eluded quantitative study due to a lack of systematic data. This paper begins to fill this gap. We introduce a new dataset based on thousands of monthly internal project status reports by the U.S. Department of Transportation that allow us to track a rulemaking effort from its origin date through its finalization.  Additionally, we develop several novel measures of prioritization and constraints that we measure both before and after a draft rule is made public,  including the degree of agency resource constraints, internal agency prioritization, changes in sub-agency political appointees, congressional and presidential attention, and the threat of litigation and sanction by courts.

Using these new data and measures, we model the drivers of prioritization and constraint as a multi-stage policy process and identify different political forces at work in each stage. Specifically, we use a multi-stage duration model to test factors that may affect the timing of rules being proposed or finalized thus identify predictors of prioritization and delay. Previous research suggests that that greater internal agency resources—in terms of personnel and budgets—will speed up rulemaking during the largely opaque pre-proposal stage, while attention from external actors, including Congress and the president, will speed up rulemaking during the more transparent notice and comment period. Our data and measures allow new tests of these theories. We show that resources, complexity, and salience have different effects on the speed of rule-writing across different stages.

Our findings hold important implications for our understanding of transparency and bureaucratic policymaking within a representative democracy.

### Summary Stats

We have initiation dates for `r length(unique(dotRIN$RIN))` unique RINs. Of these, `r sum(dotRIN$color == "Red", na.rm = T)` were marked 'delayed,'`r sum(dotRIN$color == "Yellow", na.rm = T)` were marked 'potentially delayed,' and `r sum(dotRIN$color == "Green", na.rm = T)` were marked 'on time' at the time they were last observed. However, DOT increasingly marks projects as 'not on a schedule' (`r sum(dotRIN$color == "Black", na.rm = T)` RINs were last observed in the “Black” category). `r dim(filter(dotMonthly, delayedever == T, !is.na(DOTdate)) %>% select(RIN) %>% distinct())[1]` projects were delayed at some point and `r sum(!is.na(dotRIN$whydelay))` of these give a reason for delay.

`r sum(dotRIN$initiated > as.Date("2008-01-01"), na.rm = T)` RINs were initiated after 2008. `r sum(grepl("Final Rule", dotRIN$STAGE), na.rm = T)` made it to the post-NPRM stage, `r sum(dotStage$STAGE == "Withdrawal", na.rm =T)` have been withdrawn, and `r sum(dotStage$STAGE == "Termination", na.rm =T)` were terminated.



This table shows the average number of months after initiation at which certian milestones are reached:

### Missing data

We have final outcomes for `r nrow(dotRIN %>% filter(!is.na(enddate) ))` RINs, `r nrow(dotRIN %>% filter(DOTdate == lastreport))` RINs were in progress as of `r lastreport`,  and `r nrow(d)` rules dropped out with unknown outcomes [[download .csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/judgelord/DOT/master/data/Unknown_EndDates.csv)], including these:

```{r}
kable(d %>% select(RIN, DOTdate, docket, fedreg)%>% top_n(5)) 
```

We have `r nrow(IFRs)` IFRs without Final Rules [[download .csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/judgelord/DOT/master/data/IFRs_without_finals.csv)]

```{r}

### Combining data sources

```{r timeline, fig.height = 17}

Notice how the DOT (esp. FTA and FHA) initiated a large number of projects shortly after Obama's reelection, probably waiting for assurance that they would be able to complete their work.

# Models

We are interested in two kinds of outcomes: (1) what happens? and (2) how long does it take?

Given these questions and the time-series nature of our data (monthly status reports with changing covariate values), we use duration models. Because we are interested in how policies may move through multiple stages of the policymaking process, we use a multi-state model. Doing so allows us to simultaneously model how different factors may affect a policy at different stages (i.e. states), while also modeling a common frailty. We could model each stage separately, but this would ignore correlation within rules across stages. 

Two interpretable statistics address each of our main questions. 

First, we estimate "transition probabilities" (i.e. the probability that a policy will advance to each possible future state at a given time) using the Aalen-Johansen estimator and the cumulative incidence function (the function estimating the number of observations that have transitioned to and from each state over time). 

Second, we estimate the probability that a given transition will occur in a given time window using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Covariates may increase or decrease the likelihood that a given transition will occur, thus increasing or decreasing the estimated rate of advancing from a given stage to a given stage in the policymaking process, and thus the Kaplan-Meier estimate that a given transition will occur after a given date. 

To capture common elements of each rule, we use a penalized likelihood a random effects---a [frailty](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/survival/versions/2.11-4/topics/frailty) model---with frailties for each rulemaking project (each Regulatory Identification Number). 

The paper that is most similar to the analysis we aim to conduct is ["Surviving Phases: Introducing Multi-state Survival Models"](https://github.com/judgelord/DOT/blob/master/surviving_phases_dataverse/Metzger-and-Jones-Surviving-Phases-VIM-07MAY15rev%20(1).pdf) by Metzger and Jones in Political Analysis. I have not yet found their [replication materials](https://github.com/judgelord/DOT/tree/master/surviving_phases_dataverse) to be very helpful, but their [appendix](https://github.com/judgelord/DOT/blob/master/surviving_phases_dataverse/Jones%20and%20Metzger%2C%20Appendices.pdf) has some useful illustrations.

We use `mstate`, an R package has been developed for multi-state duration modeling. Unfortunately, the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mstate/vignettes/Tutorial.pdf) does not use tidy data and is not the most helpful. Other R packages that could be relevant are `TPmsm` which also estimates transition probabilities. The JSS article [introducing mstate](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v038i07) and the [multi-state and competing risk vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/vignettes/compete.pdf) are helpful. Rpubs also has a useful [review of survival analysis](https://rpubs.com/alecri/258589).

There are several ggplot wrappers for plotting survival objects, including [ggsurvplot](https://rpubs.com/alecri/258589) and [survminer](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/survminer/survminer_cheatsheet.pdf), and `ggfortify` allows `survfit` to be used by `autoplot()`, but I opt to skip the wrappers and use tidy data. 
The `tidy()` function from the `broom` package converts `survfit` objects into tidy data frames (see [tidy.survfit documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/broom/versions/0.5.0/topics/tidy.survfit)). Unfortunately, `tidy()` does not work for `mstate` and `probtrans` objects, so tidying those objects takes more work. <!-- Once I better understand the relationship between KM estimates, Cumulative Incidence Functions, and transition probabilities, I may bypass the `mstate` package. The inconsistency in naming and structure of various survival analysis objects is very annoying.-->


## Core Model
First, we model the most common stages that rules go through with no covariates, only the dates of transition in and out of the pre-NPRM and NPRM stages. We use the DOT data with one observation per rule per stage.

Formatting data for multi-stage duration modeling requires identifying the dates of transitions to and from each stage. To do this we must define and index a set of transitions of interest. The data are formatted as one observation per rule per transition. The key variable is the days since the rulemaking project was initiated at which that transition occurred. 

```{r prepdata}
# PREP DATA ###########################
# Here we take event data with rows indexed by ID and columns for relevant dates and covariates.
# The method takes date variables, melts the data to identify the order in which various transitions occur, and, finally, models transitions in and out of each stage as a multi-state survival model. 
# This is a more generic approach than the mstate package vignettes as it does not require one to specify which transitions are possible or actually present in the data. Instead, I derive the transition matrix from the data.
# It also attempts to keep data in a tidy format (rather than special class objects). 

# First we identify the order in which events occurred in order to identify different types of transitions. 

# STEP 1: IDENTIFY TRANSITIONS AND DATES 

# These data start as one observation per ID (in this case, "RIN"). I will be extending this approach to data frames of monthly observations for each RIN
load(here("data/DOT-perRule.Rdata"))

# First, identify an ID variable so that we can split out transitions observed for each ID 
d <- original <- rename(dotRIN, id = RIN)

# Select a set of events to model (We will merge back in with covariates later.)
d %<>% select(id, Initiated, NPRMpublished, FinalRulePublished, WithdrawalPublished)

# Melt data to be one observation per event
d %<>% 
  melt(id = "id", na.rm = T, value.name = "transition_date") %>%

```

In estimation, the multi-stage duration model is stratified by transition AND fitted per transition. 

To model this, we use the multi-state method. When `Type = "mstate"` the left-hand side is broken out by transition--i.e. instead of predicting overall rate we are predicting the rate per transition, given that the observation is going to see that transition (`strata(transition)` on the right side).







---



We use `msfit()` to extract transition probabilities and fitted values (hazards).

### Statistic 1: Transition probabilities (i.e. which transition will we see?)
#### Question: What is the relationship between transition probabilities and cumulative incidence?

NOTE: this plot is backwards because `msfit()` and `probtrans` mess up the factor levels of the `transition` variable and I need to retain those new levels to match the to and from states. 

```{r probtrans}
# MODEL WITH NO COVARIATES 
d$trans <-d$transition
mod.1 <- coxph(Surv(entry, exit, status) ~ strata(trans), data = d, method = "breslow")

# FIXME
# msfit from a coxph does not allow multinomial left hand side? wtf?
# # Extract fitted values
fit <- msfit(mod.1, trans=tmat)

# Extract transition probabilities from each state
# pred = # A positive number indicating the prediction time--the time at which the prediction is made
pt0 <- probtrans(fit,  predt = 1) 

# tidy the mstate object
trans <- as.data.frame(pt0[[5]]) # transition matrix
p <- pt0[[1]] # estimate matrix
p$from <- paste(1, names(trans)[1]) # names from transition matrix
for(i in 2:length(events)){
  pt <- pt0[[i]]
  pt$from <- paste(i, names(trans)[i])
  p <- rbind(p, pt)
}

# p$pstate2[which(p$from == "1 Initiated")] <- p$pstate2[which(p$from == "1 Initiated")] + p$pstate1[which(p$from == "2 NPRM")] + 
#   p$pstate3[which(p$from == "2 NPRM")] + 
#   p$pstate4[which(p$from == "2 NPRM")]

# melt into one observation per transition per time
p %<>% melt(id = c("time", "from"), value.name = "Probability")

# separate state from variable (estimate, error) name
p %<>% separate(variable, into = c("variable", "to"), sep = "e") %>%
  # spread estimates and errors into two variables
  spread(key = "variable", value = "Probability") %>%
  # name estimate and error variables
  rename(estimate = pstat, std.error = s)

# name transitions
p$to %<>% as.factor()
p$from %<>% as.factor()
levels(p$to) <- levels(p$from)


p %<>% 
  mutate(Transition = paste0("Pr(",to,"|",from,")")) %>%
  mutate(from = factor(paste("At state", from))) %>% 
  mutate(to = factor(paste("Pr ", to))) 


# plot
p %>% filter(time <3650, !estimate %in% c(0,1) ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time/365, color = Transition, fill = Transition) ) +
  geom_step(aes(y = estimate)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymax = estimate + 1.96*std.error, 
                  ymin = estimate - 1.96*std.error),
              alpha = .2, color = NA) + 
  #geom_text(aes(y = max, x = max(time/365), label = paste0(round(max*100), "%")), hjust = 1, vjust = -.2, color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Years" , y = "Transition probability
from Aalen-Johansen estimator") +
  #facet_grid(. ~ from) + # for comparing states without covariates 
  facet_grid(to ~ from) + # for comparing covariates within states
  theme_bw()
```

#### Question: Why does `msfit` `probtrans()` with covariates require a `newdata` argument?

The model is nearly identical to the one above:

`mod.1 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ MAJOR + strata(trans), data = d, method = "breslow")`

But extracting fitted values requires "newdata"---why? The documentation does not say.

`fit <- msfit(mod.1, trans=tmat)`

### Statistic 2: Rate/Cumulative Incidence (How long does a given transition take?)



```{r mstate}
fit <- survfit(Surv(entry, exit, status * as.numeric(transition), type = "mstate") ~ strata(transition),
                 data = d) %>% tidy()

                 data = d) %>% tidy()
# FIXME

# why does this fit return 0's for values of x where there are not observations?

# replace numeric transition index with transition names (note: levels with too few observations may be dropped)
fit$state %<>% as.factor()

  facet_grid(. ~ from) + # for comparing states without covariates 
  #facet_grid(to ~ from) + # for comparing covariates within states
  theme_bw()
```  



```{r mstate-percent, include=FALSE}
# if we did not include transition strata, and thus modeled the probability for the whole stage, we have probabilities split by transition. This seems intuitive, but they looked wrong and I am not sure they are meaningful, so not including this for now. Sticking to the model where transition is on the left and right side. 
# Normalize by state (because we care about the competing risk within each state.)
# 
# Furthermore, these CIFs do not look right. I know there are more rules that go straight to the Final Rule stage than to Withdrawal, but survfit apprears to drop this transition. Why?
fit %<>% 
  group_by(Transition) %>% 
  mutate(max = max(estimate)) %>%

## Covariates

[Google spreadsheet of variables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CptLu6Xz7K14KF8PyELsiy-siYZHpi5jjmS9hMyO1xM/edit?usp=sharing)

Some are measured at the rule level, others at the agency level, and others for all rules at a given point in time. Many vary by month or year. We will include a frailty by rule and may need cluster standard errors by rule or agency depending on the covariates.

Many covariates may be correlated and we really should be modeling them as indicators of the latent factors that affect policymaking. For example, observed covariates may be grouped into broader, more discrete concepts like the resources the agency has, the technical complexity of the rule, and the political contentiousness of the rule.

##### Resources 
Resources measures:

- sub-agency budget? - can we get the budget for rulemaking activities? Is this different than estimating SES? 

- "lack of resources" or "lack of staffing" claimed [0,1], a subset of delayed rules

- number of SES / # of rules per year (ideally at sub-agency level if we have SES data for that)

- secretary prompt [0,1] - how many missing? 

- Non-acting subagency head [0,1]

- Same president as initiation date [0,1]

- Same secretary as initiation date [0,1]

- Same subagency head as initiation date [0,1]

##### Complexity  

Complexity measurements:

- "coordination necessary" claimed [0,1], subset of delayed rules

- “unanticipated issues/impacts requiring further analysis”*“awaiting development of additional data” claimed [0,1], a subset of delayed rules

- the score of the abstract on Benoit's political sophistication/complexity

- second comment period [1,0] (though this may also be a measure of external, interest group constraint) 

- the number of comments? (to me this is more about salience and contentiousness than complexity)

- MORE MEASURES? 

##### Contentiousness: 
 White House and Secretary alignment measures:
 
- "other, higher priorities" claimed [0,1] (is it right to interpret this way? Priority could also be internal...which would make it, what? Not a resource per se)

- initiated under same president [0,1] (same party president? we have a few started under Clinton, finished under Obama) 

- went to Secretary twice [0,1]

- days between going to secretary going to ORIA (average if multiple times)

- went to ORIA twice [0,1]

- Did ORIA make changes [0,1]

- days between going to ORIA and publication (count days from the first or last time at ORIA? )

Congress alignment measures:

- positive-negative sentiment words in subcommittee budget report

- positive-negative sentiment words in the subcommittee hearing

- legislative deadline exists [0,1]

- legislative deadline past [0,1]

- prompting action is legislation [0,1] (speeds up rulemaking?)

- legislation is pending [0,1] (slows rulemaking)

- Reg flex required [0,1] slowing? 

- unified congress 

Litigation threat:

- court deadline exists [0,1]

- court deadline past [0,1]

- number of lawsuits against the subagency in the past x years

- avg number of lawsuits against the agency per year of administration (this is perhaps better suited for a model that is not just DOT)

- litigation threatened in comments? [0,1]

## Congressional attention/opposition: 

Below are examples of positive and negative sentiment about the FAA from the 2018 appropriations subcommittee report. Much it is very neutral, but it is fair to say that this actually reflects neutral attitudes. Sentiment analysis allows us to tally up the positive and negative words for each subagency. Other scholars have measured the length of the section on each subagency, but this mostly just reflects the size and diversity of its budget.

#### Examples:

POSITIVE: 

The Committee is encouraged 
by the additional measures the FAA is taking to enhance 
outreach to communities affected by new flightpaths. The 
Committee recommendation includes an additional $2,000,000 to 
support the FAA's ongoing efforts to address community noise 
concerns.
The Committee supports 
research that is being conducted through the FAA's Center of 
Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuel and Environment, the 
Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT) on the impact of 
aviation noise on both sleep and cardiovascular health.
The Committee commends the FAA Office 
of Commercial Space Transportation's efforts to promote private 
sector lunar exploration and development and encourages the FAA 
to explicitly define non-interference and to enhance its 
payload review process to provide companies planning private 
sector lunar development with the security and predictability 
necessary to support substantial investments. 

NEGATIVE:

The Committee is concerned by the FAA's decision to extend by five years its aging Mission Support Network, a 
decision which carries both technology and cost implications.
