1,DOT,FALSE,0,2000-02-01T23:59:59-05:00,NA,"THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE DOT's DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROCEDURES     I feel the DOT's testing procedures are unconstitutional.     Even though they are upheld by the Laws Courts and Judges they are no more constitutional than was slavery or not allowing women the right to vote.These testing procedures should be eliminated.     For a real life example let me submit this: on Sept. 24th. 1999 at the end of my work shift at 7:30 Am. I feel I had my constitutional rights violated.     I was forced to participate at my work's clinic in your random drug test program against my will.      The termination of my job if I refused was used to force me to participate.     I tested negative. I was clean and free of any violations.     I feel this is an infringement on my constitutional rights. I was forced to give up my constitutional rights against:     oinvasion of privacy     ounreasonable searches and seizures     ogiving up of potential evidence against myself. ( a possible ""false positive"" )This punishing of innocent U.S. citizen employees for the alleged possible guilty acts of other employees should stop.    This enforcement of a mandated unconstitutional government law by  business' such as  my place of work should be eliminated.     I feel the U.S. government is getting around the "" due process "" and "" innocent until proven guilty "" rights of citizens by mandating and forcing business' to pressure force harass discriminate coherse and subject their employees to these unconstitutional testing procedures.     The safety issue must be addressed in a different way without violating our precious Constitution of the U.S.A.     One possible remedy: if you feel an employee is guilty of an offense have that employee arrested and taken to court where justice can be meted out for or against the defendant or the plaintiff.

We are a Third Party Administrator working primarily with small businesses.  They depend on us to receive and transmit the results for them because:     A.  They usually do not have a secure FAX.     B.  As small businesses they frequently do not have the person designated to receive the results available to speak to the MRO whenever he/she calls.   However WE as their TPA have an answering service who will alert us and we will call the MRO right back to have the results FAXed to our SECURE FAX.  Then we will call the employer until we get ahold of the designee and then also mail themthe hard copy to attention of the designated person with CONFIDENTIAL on the envelope.       C.

3,DOT,FALSE,0,2001-06-07T23:59:59-04:00,NA,Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the new 49 CFR Part 26 rule related to Participation by Disadvantaged Business Enterprises in Department of Transportation Financial Assistance Programs; Memorandum of  Understanding With the Small Business Administration; Uniform Forms and Other Revisions.  The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (ADOT&PF) has the following comments on this NRPM.еб In General On June 24 1999 this office requested official guidance under the provisions of 49 CFR 26.9(a) regarding the collection of financial (Personal Net Worth) information from Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) corporations.  To date this request has not been answered with anything in writing from USDOT.  This quest for an official answer was renewed with USDOT in May 2000 at the National Civil Rights Transportation Conference.  We were assured an answer by the end of May 2000.  This matter was again directed to USDOT through Federal Highway officials at a meeting of the AASHTO subcommittee on Civil Rights in March of this year.  We have been told at different times that informal written guidance would be forthcoming and that there is legislation pending on this matter.  No written information has been conveyed on this matter.ANCSA's are a creature created by Congress and operate in a fundamentally different fashion that other Native American organizations such as tribes and other DBE firms.  There are 13 regional corporations and 12 of the 13 have village corporations for each village in its region.  Alaska Natives are individual shareholders (owners) in their regional and village corporations.  The owners elect a board of directors who serve in a part time capacity to run the business of the corporation.  The board of directors hires a full time administrative staff (predominantly non-disadvantaged individuals) to run the day-to-day affairs of the corporation.  Under this described scenario few if any ANCSA corporations would qualify as DBE firms according to the requirement for disadvantaged owners to control the corporation.  In implementing these regulations we have found this to be true and it has resulted in a substantially reduced number of ANCSA firms certified by our DOT.  We view this situation as a serious problem because it disproportionately affects one group of disadvantaged businesses (ANCSAs) that are operating under rules adopted by Congress.There are serious and grievous implications for the State of Alaska and ANCSA corporations by this lack of response from USDOT.  Based on the absence of official guidance we have denied certification to firms that have appealed our decision to USDOT.  We believe USDOT has a fundamental administrative responsibility to reply to any recipient's request for official guidance.  The reason we bring this matter up is that it will continue to be an issue for the new Uniform Application Form because it again fails to provide sufficient guidance on how to collect PNW information from ANCSA corporations.еб Reporting FormADOT&PF supports the rule change to require reporting on a semi-annual basis instead of the current quarterly basis.  We also support the requirement to retain basic program data for at least three years.еб Uniform Application FormADOT&PF supports the concept of a National Uniform Application form with the understanding that it will be clearly stated in plain language that certification into the SBA 8A program will not necessarily translate into certification into the DBE program at USDOT.  We believe the initial wording on statements from SBA and the Office of the Secretary of Transportation did not clearly make this distinction and has lead to needless time spent by ADOT&PF staff explaining the differences to businesses challenging certification decisions made by our office based on vague wording in the initial MOU.  еб Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)ADOT&PF supports clearly worded statements on the application and in the MOU that indicate the application and certification of a business is subject to the requirements of each program and that acceptance into one does not guarantee reciprocity into the other.еб Personal Net Worth (PNW)We have some problems with the certification of PNW by a CPA based on the method described in 49 CFR Part 26 which is not consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP) for public accountancy.  CPAs will only report what is reported to them by their client and CPAs will provide a certifying statement that will contain such a disclaimer.  If USDOT is determined to use this modified method of accounting for PNW then there should be a notarized statement from the DBE firm owner(s) to their CPA that they have provided all information required to be accounted for under 49 CFR Part 26 for PNW.  The penalty for falsification of such a PNW statement should be subject to prosecution by USDOT and permanent disqualification from the DBE program.  There should also be a notarized statement from the CPA stating they have read and understand 49 CFR Part 26 and prepared the PNW in accordance with its provisions.ADOT&PF also believes PNW information should be collected from a DBE's spouse to verify assets and to ensure the DBE has not altered its true PNW to continue to qualify for the program.  We have had more than a couple of instances in the past two years with the implementation of the new DBE regulations where the DBE transferred assets to the spouse to avoid exceeding the size limitations.Exclusion of IRAs pension plans and 401K plans from a PNW artificially manipulates a person's true PNW.  These assets while not always readily accessible like real estate and other property have tangible and real values that can be liquidated to add to an individuals personal wealth.  We recommend these assets remain reportable on a PNW statement at its current market value.еб Proof of EthnicityWith the growth in America's multi-racial population it has become increasingly difficult to determine an applicant's presumptive eligibility for the DBE program based solely on a statement when there are many other indicators that the applicant is a Caucasian male.  Proof of ethnicity such as membership in an American Indian tribe or birth records indicating a race other than Caucasian have all been helpful in determining an applicant's presumptive eligibility.  Such proof will help make a determination but may not always resolve the matter to the satisfaction of complainants alleging certain individuals are not presumptively eligible.   We recommend USDOT provide for an appeal process to USDOT for aggrieved individuals that wish to dispute the presumptive eligibility of any DBE firm.,DOT-OST-2000-7639,Participation by Disadvantaged Business Enterprises in Department of Transportation Financial Assistance Programs; Memorandum of Understanding with the Small Business Administration; Uniform Forms and Other Revisions,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2000-7639-0043,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2001-06-06T00:00:00-04:00,NA,The Alaska Department of Transportation and Publlic Facilities,2105-AC88,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
4,DOT,FALSE,0,2001-06-29T23:59:59-04:00,NA,I would like to comment on the DOT regulation 46 CFR 40.25. This change was not found in the NPRM that was sent out back in 1999. I would have liked to had a chance to comment on it before it was added to the final rule. This change is going to cause many problems for the marine industry. I would like to see the Coast Guards drug rules allow of an exclusion from 46 CFR 40.25.The vessel that our company operates has crewmembers that are covered by the coast guards drug  & alcohol-testing program. We currently pre-employment drug test 115 - 130 prospective employees per year. It looks like we are going to have to hire someone full time to just submit the paper work to other companies and respond to requests from other companies. Our company would have the responsibility to respond to a possible 200 plus request from other companies (that is if the employes who used to work for us only applies to one other company in the next 2 years). If our x-employes apply to 4 different marine employers with in the 2 years after he/she has worked for us then we could have upwards of 400 plus releases of information to send back to other marine employers. I also noticed that good faith effort is not defined under 40.25 (d) in reference to us obtaining information from other employers. Is this going to be defined? Is a good faith effort 2 faxes and one call or is it 10 calls 10 faxes and 3 certified letters? Suppose we make a good faith effort and still get no response we allow our new employee to continue to work for us after 30 days; are we to assume that the courts will not hold us at fault if our new employee causes a serious marine accident in the future and it is found that he had tested positive (for another employer) and never competed his drug rehab (for another employer)? It is very unreasonable to expect any company to keep up with the flood of paperwork that this new rule will create.For it to be stated that this rule has no economic impact is absurd.,DOT-OST-1999-6578,Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-1999-6578-0419,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2001-06-29T00:00:00-04:00,NA,Kevin H.

6,DOT,FALSE,0,2002-06-11T23:59:59-04:00,NA,June 10 2002MEMORANDUM FOR PRESIDENT=S MANAGEMENT COUNCILFROM:John D. GrahamSUBJECT:Agency Draft Information Quality GuidelinesThe quality of information disseminated to the public by the Federal Government needs to be improved.  Reflecting this need Congress recently directed OMB to issue government-wide guidelines that Aprovide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.@  The Administration is committed to vigorous implementation of this information quality law.  OMB issued government-wide information quality guidelines on September 28 last year.  Each Federal agency is now required to issue its own guidelines that will ensure the quality of information that it disseminates.  These guidelines must include mechanisms to allow the public to seek correction of disseminated information that does not comply with the information quality standards in the OMB or agency guidelines.  To permit public participation and comment and to facilitate interagency coordination agencies are expected to make their draft guidelines available for public comment.  My staff and I have completed a preliminary review of the draft agency guidelines currently available for public comment.  We want to thank you for the substantial effort and careful deliberation reflected in the agency drafts.  Agencies with highly diverse program responsibilities disseminate a wide variety of kinds of information to serve many different purposes.  The agency drafts properly reflect this variety.  Some agencies have developed particularly noteworthy provisions that I would suggest for consideration by other agencies in reviewing and revising their own draft guidance.  I would also like to point out some provisions in agency drafts that do not appear consistent with the text and intent of the OMB guidelines or are otherwise contrary to Administration policy.Based on our review I have attached a discussion of important issues identified noteworthy approaches for consideration and provided guidance on those provisions that need to be adopted uniformly in all agency guidance.  I request that you send this attachment to the appropriate officials who are responsible for developing your agency=s information quality guidelines. We have asked agencies to submit draft final guidelines to us for review by August 1 (which we have extended from an original July 1 deadline).  We encourage you to use this extra time to extend your public comment period.  In light of the recent decision to allow additional time for agencies to extend the period for public comment on agency guidelines (and thus compress the time available for final OMB review) it is my intention to have these OIRA comments considered in conjunction with public comments as agencies shape their final guidelines.As a related matter I should note that Mark Forman of OMB is leading work on a content model for presenting information on the web.  It will include guidelines on how to present web content how agencies should identify web-based material and general guidelines for what should go on the public internet.AttachmentJune 10 2002OIRA REVIEW OF INFORMATION QUALITY GUIDELINES DRAFTED BY AGENCIESBy October 1 2002 agencies must publish in the Federal Register a notice that the agency=s final guidelines are available on the Internet.  Agencies must also provide OMB an opportunity to review each agency=s draft final guidelines before they are issued.  Drafts must be submitted to OMB no later than August 1.The underlying legislation is Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-554; H.R. 5658).   The OMB Information Quality Guidelines can be found in the Federal Register for September 28 2001 (66 FR 49718) and as amended for February 22 2002 (67 FR 8452).  This attachment discusses important policy issues raised by the agency drafts identifies noteworthy approaches for consideration and provides guidance on those provisions that need to be uniformly adopted in all agency information quality guidelines.  We urge that draft guidelines submitted for OMB review reflect consideration of this guidance as well as the public comments.I.  SCOPE OF AGENCY GUIDELINES.In this topic we discuss a number of constructive approaches agencies used to define the kinds of information that are covered by their guidelines.  In some cases we refer to provisions from agency drafts.  These examples are quoted at the end of this attachment.We cite these agency draft provisions as useful constructive approaches.  We caution however that these examples are only agency proposals.  Based on public comment and other review the agencies may further refine these examples.The OMB definitions of Ainformation@ and Adissemination@ establish the scope of these guidelines.  Both definitions contain exceptions.  Agencies have elaborated upon the definitions of information and dissemination and the exceptions thereto to both broaden and narrow their scope.  The specific examples discussed below include modifications that appear reasonable and consistent with the approach OMB takes in its guidelines as well as suggestions for improvement and greater consistency with the OMB guidelines.  We suggest that agencies consider these approaches for their own use.Use of Statements of AIntent@ to Define Scope.  Some agencies used statements of intent or purpose to limit the scope of these guidelines.  Such use of Aintent@ clarifies the nature of the inclusion or exclusion in a way to avoid having incidental or inadvertent public disclosure undermine the practical administration of the definition or exclusion.  For example some agencies insert the concept of Aintent@ into the exemption for intra- or inter-agency use of sharing of information e.g. exempted is Ainformation ... not disseminated to the public including documents intended only for inter-agency and intra-agency communications@ (ED 1 & 4).  On the other hand some agencies quote this definition as stated in the OMB guidelines literally and do not insert a concept of intent.  They may wish to include a concept of Aintent@ to avoid inadvertent public disclosure from undermining practical administration of the guidelines.Exemption for Press Releases.  Some agencies narrowed the exemption in the OMB definition to provide that the agency should already have disseminated the information discussed in the press release in another way.  For example EPA states AThese guidelines do not apply to press releases fact sheets press conferences or similar communications in any medium that announce support the announcement or give public notice of information EPA has disseminated elsewhere@ (EPA 15).  This limitation avoids creating an incentive to misuse press releases to circumvent information quality standards.Exemption for Public Filings.  Some agencies refined the exemption for public filings to permit agencies to Apass through@ information not subject to the guidelines while properly applying the agency and OMB guidelines to third-party information that the agency disseminates.  Agencies need to qualify the public filing exemption to ensure that the agency guidelines continue to apply to third-party information that the agency disseminates as we discuss below under II ACoverage of >Third-Party= Information under the Guidelines.@Exclusion For Agency Employed Scientist Grantee or Contractor.  The preamble to the OMB guidelines discusses situations in which the dissemination of information by an agency-employed scientist grantee or contractor is not subject to the guidelines namely those situations in which they Apublish and communicate their research findings in the same manner as their academic colleagues@ and thus do not imply official agency endorsement of their views or findings (67 FR 8453-54 February 22 2002).  On the other hand an agency disseminates information Awhere an agency has directed a third-party to disseminate information or where the agency has the authority to review and approve the information before release@ (67 FR 8454 February 22 2002).  Agencies that did not explicitly include such an exemption may wish to consider doing so but need to do so in the carefully balanced ways quoted at the end of this attachment.Exclusion for Testimony and Other Submissions to Congress.  Some agencies exclude Ainformation presented to Congress (as part of the legislative or oversight processes e.g. testimony of officials information or drafting assistance provided to Congress in connection with pending or proposed legislation) that is not simultaneously disseminated to the public@ (Justice 3; DOT 9).  As with the exemption for press releases we think it would be better for agencies to narrow this exemption to provide that the agency should already have disseminated the information discussed in the testimony in another way.  This limitation would avoid creating an incentive to misuse testimony and other submissions to Congress to circumvent information quality standards.Exemption for Subpoenas or Adjudicative Processes.  The preamble to the OMB guidelines states that AThe exemption from the definition of >dissemination= for >adjudicative processes= is intended to exclude ... the findings and determinations that an agency makes in the course of adjudications involving specific parties.  There are well-established procedural safeguards and rights to address the quality of adjudicatory decisions and to provide persons with an opportunity to contest decisions.  These guidelines do not impose any additional requirements on agencies during adjudicative proceedings and do not provide parties to such adjudicative proceedings any additional rights of challenge or appeal@ (67 FR 8454 February 22 2002).  Some agencies adapted the OMB exception very carefully.  Other agencies may have broadened this exemption beyond OMB=s intent; they need to limit this exemption carefully to be consistent with OMB=s intent both as to the adjudicative procedures that are included and the scope of the information covered.Effective Date.  The OMB guidelines establish two somewhat different effective dates (III.4).  An agency=s obligation to conduct a pre-dissemination review of information quality starts only on October 1: AThe agency=s pre-dissemination review under paragraph III.2 shall apply to information that the agency first disseminates on or after October 1 2002.@  An agency=s obligation to allow the public to seek the  correction of information that does not comply with the information quality standards in OMB or agency guidelines starts on October 1 2002 for information that the agency disseminates on or after October 1 2002 even if the agency first disseminated that information before October 1: AThe agency=s administrative mechanisms under paragraph III.3 shall apply to information that the agency disseminates on or after October 1 2002 regardless of when the agency first disseminated the information.@  Some agencies followed the OMB guidelines carefully in describing when the information quality guidelines will take effect:  AThe DOJ information quality guidelines will become effective on October 1 2002.  These guidelines will cover information disseminated on or after October 1 2002 regardless of when the information was first disseminated@ (Justice  2).   Other agencies need to be careful to track accurately the OMB guidelines in this regard (III.4).The effective date for the agency=s administrative mechanisms raises the issue of what constitutes agency dissemination of information after October 1 2002 if the agency first disseminated this information earlier.DOT defines dissemination after October 1 to exclude archived information that had been disseminated previously.  AAs provided in OMB=s guidelines these guidelines apply only to information disseminated on or after October 1 2002.  The fact that an information product that was disseminated by DOT before this date is still maintained by the Department (e.g. in DOT=s files in publications that DOT continues to distribute on a website) does not make the information subject to these guidelines or to the request for correction process@ (DOT  23).  This interpretation is consistent with OMB=s intent and equivalent to the Aarchival records@ exemption.Still to be considered is how a complainant demonstrates that an agency disseminates information after October 1 2002 if the agency first disseminated that information before October 1 2002.  For example existing official agency data bases publicly available through agency websites or other means that serve agency program responsibilities and/or are relied upon by the public as official government data need to be subject to the Section 515 administrative mechanisms to address public complaints because they are in effect constantly being redisseminated.  II.  COVERAGE OF ATHIRD-PARTY@ INFORMATION UNDER THE GUIDELINES.The preamble to the OMB guidelines states AIf an agency as an institution disseminates information prepared by an outside party in a manner that reasonably suggests that the agency agrees with the information this appearance of having the information represent agency views makes agency dissemination of the information subject to these guidelines@ (67 FR 8454 February 22 2002).  Reinforcing this statement of policy OMB also provided an example in its preamble concerning the applicability of the OMB and agency information quality standards to third-party studies relied upon by an agency as support for a proposed rulemaking even if the third-party studies had been published before the agency=s use of them (67 FR 8457 February 22 2002).DOT incorporated these principles from the OMB guidelines by stating that an agency disseminates information if it relies on information in support of a rulemaking.   AIf the Department is to rely on technical scientific or economic information submitted by for example a commenter to a proposed rule that information would need to meet appropriate standards of objectivity and utility@ (DOT 3). AThe standards of these guidelines apply not only to information that DOT generates but also to information that other parties provide to DOT if the other parties seek to have the Department rely upon or disseminate this information or the Department decides to do so@  (DOT 8).EPA explicitly includes a provision embodying the OMB example: AIf a particular distribution of information is not covered by these guidelines the guidelines may still apply to a subsequent distribution of the information in which EPA adopts endorses or uses the information to formulate or support a regulation guidance or other Agency decision or position@ (EPA 17).   Other agencies B particularly those likely to be involved with using and/or disseminating Ainfluential@ information B must include similar provisions in their guidelines.III.  AGENCY COMMITMENT TO INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS.In this topic we discuss (1) ways in which agencies need to commit to information quality standards and (2) aspects of how those standards should be defined.Performance Standards.  The OMB guidelines state that AOverall agencies shall adopt a basic standard of quality (including objectivity utility and integrity) as a performance goal and should take appropriate steps to incorporate information quality criteria into agency information dissemination practices@ (III.1).  The Ainformation quality criteria@ are set forth in the definitions of AQuality@ AUtility@ AObjectivity@ and AIntegrity@ (V.1-4).  Closely related definitions are those for Ainfluential@ information when used in the phrase Ainfluential scientific financial or statistical information@ and for Areproducibility@ (V.9-10).Each agency in structuring its information quality guidelines must state the agency=s information quality criteria (as defined in the OMB and agency guidelines) as performance goals that the agency seeks to attain.  Each agency needs to adopt explicitly each aspect of each definition of quality utility objectivity and integrity as an agency information quality standard.  Each agency also must explicitly state that it intends to achieve each standard.  Otherwise there will be no benchmark against which a public complainant will be able to suggest non-attainment. The OMB guidelines also state that AAs a matter of good and effective agency information resources management agencies shall develop a process for reviewing the quality (including the objectivity utility and integrity) of information before it is disseminated@ (III.2).  Given that guideline many agencies describe in considerable detail the kinds of activities they now undertake to assure information quality.  Regardless we stress that a mere description of current practices B however good B is not a substitute for explicit performance goals.  At a minimum each agency must embrace the OMB quality definitions as information quality standards they are seeking to attain.  Examples of constructive agency statements are quoted at the end of this attachment.  In addition some agencies and agency components do not appear to have adopted any standards for information quality (utility objectivity integrity) and/or defined Ainfluential@ or Areproducibility@ in ways applicable to them.  Each agency must either define its standards in ways applicable to it and consistent with the standards in the OMB guidelines or explicitly adopt the standards from the OMB guidelines as the agency or component standards.  For an agency that does not anticipate disseminating much information that is defined as Ainfluential@ we suggest that the agency simply adopt the standards from the OMB guidelines as its own.Core Definition of AObjectivity@.   The OMB definition of  Aobjectivity@ is the most detailed and complex.  This definition has different aspects some that apply to all information covered by the OMB guidelines others that apply only to Ainfluential@ information.  The first issue relates to all covered information.  According to the OMB guidelines A >Objectivity= has two distinct elements presentation and substance.  a.  >Objectivity= includes whether disseminated information is being presented in an accurate clear complete and unbiased manner [ -- as well as Awithin a proper context@]. ...b.   In addition >objectivity= involves a focus on ensuring accurate reliable and unbiased information@ (V.3.). Some agencies have summarized this aspect of the definition of Aobjectivity@ accurately.  Other agencies in summarizing the OMB standard appear to have left out some of the important standards; those agencies need to summarize the OMB standard accurately.  Peer Review.  The discussion of peer review in the definition of Aobjectivity@ relates to all covered information.  AIf data and analytic results have been subject to formal independent external peer review the information may generally be presumed to be of acceptable objectivity [if the peer review satisfies >the general criteria for competent and credible peer review= cited in the definition].  However this presumption is rebuttable based on a persuasive showing by the petitioner in a particular instance@ (V.3.b.i).  If an agency or component engages in peer review it needs to discuss the ways in which it will adhere to the OMB standard in its guidelines.  These peer review standards are not limited to information defined as Ainfluential@.  These OMB peer review standards apply to all information covered by these guidelines and need to be integrated into existing agency peer review standards applicable to covered information.  In addition agencies must point out B to be consistent with the OMB standard B that the presumption of objectivity afforded to formal independent external peer review is rebuttable although the burden of proof as explained more fully below is on the complainant.AInfluential@ and AReproducibility@.  The next issue relates to agency treatment of influential  information.  AIf an agency is responsible for disseminating influential scientific financial or statistical information agency guidelines shall include a high degree of transparency about data and methods to facilitate the reproducibility of such information by qualified third parties@ (V.3.b.ii; see V.9 for definition of Ainfluential@).Several agencies provided a carefully considered discussion of the meaning of Ainfluential@ in their drafts.  See provisions quoted at the end of this attachment.AOriginal and supporting data@ and Aanalytic results@.  With regard to influential information the OMB guidelines further distinguish between Aoriginal and supporting data@ and Aanalytic results@. With regard to original and supporting data related thereto agency guidelines shall not require that all disseminated data be subjected to a reproducibility requirement.  Agencies may identify in consultation with the relevant scientific and technical communities those particular types of data that can practicably be subjected to a reproducibility requirement (V.3.b.ii.A).With regard to analytic results related thereto agency guidelines shall generally require sufficient transparency about data and methods that an independent reanalysis could be undertaken by a qualified member of the public. ...   i. ... Making the data and methods publicly available will assist in determining whether analytic results are reproducible.  However the objectivity standard does not override other compelling interests such as privacy trade secrets intellectual property and other confidentiality protections.ii.In situations where public access ... will not occur ... agencies shall  apply especially rigorous robustness checks to analytic results and document what checks were undertaken.  Agency guidelines shall in all cases require a disclosure of the specific data sources ... used and the specific quantitative methods and assumptions ... employed (V.3.b.ii.B). In draft agency guidelines it does not appear that any agency undertook to delineate when Aoriginal and supporting data@ would be subject to a reproducibility requirement.  Presumably the public comment period is being used to seek views from the relevant scientific and technical communities.  If at the end of the public comment period an agency is not prepared to identify what kinds of original and supporting data will be subject to the reproducibility standard then the agency must include in its guidelines a statement to the effect that the agency shall assure reproducibility for those kinds of original and supporting data according to Acommonly accepted scientific financial or statistical standards@ (suggested language).As to Aanalytic results@ it appears that a number of agencies anticipate that reproducibility will sometimes not be achievable through public access because of confidentiality protections or other compelling interests.  In such cases some agencies do not mention the need to Aapply especially rigorous robustness checks.@  Instead they describe their intent to disclose specific data sources and specific quantitative methods and assumptions. In such situations agencies need to state explicitly their commitment to the standards stated in the OMB guidelines to applying Aespecially rigorous robustness checks@ to analytic results and document what checks were undertaken.  In addition agency guidelines must in all cases explicitly require a disclosure of the specific data sources quantitative methods and assumptions used.  We also recommend that agencies in generating (or contracting to generate) influential information for dissemination encourage arrangements that will permit appropriate public access to the related original and supporting data and analytic results.Analysis of Risks to Human Health Safety and the Environment.  With regard to influential information the OMB guidelines also state that AWith regard to analysis of risks to human health safety and the environment ... agencies shall either adopt or adapt the quality principles applied by Congress to risk information used and disseminated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(3)(A) & (B))@ (V.3.b.ii.C).Some agencies discussed these Congressional risk information quality standards; some agencies discussed these in a limited context; and other agencies failed to mention these standards at all.  Those agencies that are likely to use and/or disseminate influential information in their analysis of Arisks to human health safety and the environment@ need to clearly state that they are adopting the SDWA standards or justify in what ways and for what kinds of information the agency is adapting the SDWA standards.  FDA adapts the SDWA standards in a carefully considered practical way (HHS/FDA 18-20).  We note that FDA read the SDWA standards as applicable to a risk assessment document made available to the public and did not limit their applicability only to documents related to a rulemaking; that is the proper approach. IV.  QUALITY INTEGRAL TO CREATION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.The OMB guidelines state that AAs a matter of good and effective agency information resources management agencies shall treat information quality as integral to every step of an agency=s development of information including creation collection maintenance and dissemination.  This process shall enable the agency to substantiate the quality of the information it has disseminated through documentation or other means appropriate to the information@ (III.2).  Consistent with the OMB guidelines the Small Business Administration explicitly included Ainformation development@ Ainformation acquisition@ and Ainformation maintenance@ within the scope of its information quality guidelines as quoted at the end of this attachment.In this light we note that each agency is already required to demonstrate the Apractical utility@ of a proposed collection of information in its PRA submission i.e. for draft information collections designed to gather information that the agency plans to disseminate.  Thus we think it important that each agency should declare in its guidelines that it will demonstrate in its PRA clearance packages that each such draft information collection will result in information that will be collected maintained and used in a way consistent with the OMB and agency information quality standards.  It is important that we make use of the PRA clearance process to help improve the quality of information that agencies collect and disseminate.  Thus OMB will approve only those information collections that are likely to obtain data that will comply with the OMB and agency information quality guidelines.V.  ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANISM TO ADDRESS PUBLIC COMPLAINTS.Applicable Standards.  The OMB guidelines state ATo facilitate public review agencies shall establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain where appropriate timely correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with OMB or agency guidelines@ (III.3).Some agencies discuss compliance with both the OMB and agency information quality standards in their discussion of the complaint mechanism.  Others discuss compliance only with the agency information quality standards.  To be consistent with the OMB guidelines each agency should explicitly refer complainants to all of the applicable guidelines B the OMB department and departmental component=s guidelines B as the applicable information quality standards.AAffected Person@.  Some agencies defined Aaffected person@ quite broadly.  For example AThe term >affected person= means anyone who may benefit or be harmed by the disseminated information.  This includes persons who are seeking to address information about themselves as well as persons who use information@ (OFHEO 5).  HHS took an even more open approach.  Rather than defining Aaffected person@ HHS just asks the complainant to Adescribe how the person submitting the complaint is affected by the information error@ (HHS 13). This invites the complainant to describe how he/she is affected but specifically avoids any provision that would use this answer to limit or restrict who can point out an error in an agency=s dissemination of information.  We prefer the HHS approach because it best ensures full public access to the complaint process a goal of Section 515 and the OMB guidelines.  The focus of the complaint process should be on the merits of the complaint not on the possible interests or qualifications of the complainant.   Other agencies need to adopt a similar approach.Decision Criteria and Burden of Proof for Resolving Complaints.  Several agencies state that: ARequesters should be aware that they bear the >burden of proof= with respect to the necessity for correction as well as with respect to the type of correction they seek@ (Justice 6).  Having the burden of proof on the complainant is consistent with the OMB guidelines and will be helpful in permitting agencies to dismiss frivolous or speculative complaints.  All agencies should make this clear in describing their complaint mechanism to the public.  We quote at the end of this attachment carefully presented statements of the decision criteria and approaches that several agencies plan to follow in resolving complaints. Time Periods for Resolving Complaints and Any Appeals.  The OMB guidelines state AAgencies shall specify appropriate time periods for agency decisions on whether and how to correct the information and agencies shall notify the affected persons of the corrections made ... The agency shall establish an administrative appeal process to review the agency=s initial decision and specify appropriate time limits in which to resolve ... requests for reconsideration@ (III.3.i & ii).Each agency must state in its guidelines the time periods for making decisions on both complaints and also on any appeals.  Exceptions for unusual cases are appropriate.Some agencies set a time limit within which after receiving notice of an initial decision the complainant could file an appeal generally 30 days.  Setting a time limit for filing appeals appears reasonable.Some agencies also seek to set time limits for submission of original complaints (in effect a form of a statute of limitations).  OMB has concerns about the potential unintended effects of such limits and will be reviewing them carefully.  Sometimes agencies continue long after the agencies= initial dissemination to adopt endorse or use information and thus in effect continue to disseminate it.  Similarly agencies may continue to maintain ongoing official agency data bases publicly available through agency websites or other means that serve agency program responsibilities and/or are relied upon by the public that are in effect constantly being redisseminated.  The damaging effects of poor quality information may not occur or be perceived to have occurred until well after the information was originally disseminated.An Objective Appeals Mechanism.  The preamble to the OMB guidelines discusses our intent that agencies establish an objective appeals mechanism.  ARecognizing that many agencies already have a process in place to respond to public concerns it is not necessarily OMB=s intent to require these agencies to establish a new or different process.  Rather our intent is to ensure that agency guidelines specify an objective administrative appeal process that upon further complaint by the affected person reviews an agency=s decision to disagree with the correction request.   An objective process will ensure that the office that originally disseminates the information does not have a responsibility for both the initial response and resolution of a disagreement@ (67 FR 8458 February 22 2002).Some agencies discuss how they plan institutionally to structure their complaint and appeal procedures.  Others do not.  We strongly suggest that agencies describe to the public how they plan to resolve any complaints and appeals in order to build public confidence in both the reality and appearance of a neutral fair decision mechanism.To enhance transparency we also suggest that agencies provide the public with timely notice of what information the agency intends to correct after it makes a decision to correct it.  In the annual report to OMB agencies should also this information as well as a status report on the numbers and kinds of petitions for corrections appeals and any denials or grants of petitions for reconsideration or appeals.  Agencies are encouraged to the extent they practi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ably can to give more timely disclosure of this information through e.g.  the use of electronic dockets or agency websites they are encouraged to do so.We note in this regard that a number of agencies emphasize that their guidelines are not intended to provide any right to judicial review.  A few agencies even stress that their guidelines may not be applicable based on unspecified circumstances and that the agency may be free to differ from the guidelines where the agency considers such action appropriate.   Regardless of what kinds of litigation-oriented disclaimers the agencies may include agency guidelines should not suggest that agencies are free to disregard their own guidelines.  Therefore if you believe it is important to make statements that your agency=s guidelines are not intended to provide rights of judicial review we ask that you not include extraneous assertions that appear to suggest that the OMB and agency information quality standards are not statements of government-wide policy i.e. government-wide quality standards which an agency is free to ignore based on unspecified circumstances.  In addition agencies should be aware that their statements regarding judicial enforceability might not be controlling in the event of litigation.VI.  MELDING THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 515 INTO THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF OTHER STATUTES.The agencies take a uniform approach to complaints filed concerning information disseminated in the course of conducting a rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (providing public notice to obtain public comment then issuing the regulation in final form).  The agencies meld the requirement to establish a Section 515 administrative mechanism to address public complaints into the procedures of the APA NEPA and other more specific public-comment statutes.  This melding of Section 515 complaint procedures into the structure of existing statutes seems reasonable and is discussed extremely well by a number of agencies.  Of course the substantive standards of quality the information quality standards provided in the OMB and agency guidelines remain applicable to any such dissemination of information.  Examples of well-reasoned agency statements are quoted at the end of this attachment.  One of the agency discussions raises an interesting issue: Requests for Correction Concerning Information on Which DOJ Has Sought Public Comment. Information on which DOJ has sought public comment includes a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) studies cited in an NPRM a regulatory evaluation or cost-benefit analysis pertaining to an NPRM a preliminary environmental impact analysis a notice of availability and request for comment on a risk assessment.DOJ's response to the request for correction will normally be incorporated in the next document it issues in the matter concerning which it had sought comment. The response will be provided in this document rather than in a separate communication.  DOJ may choose to provide an earlier response if doing so is appropriate and will not delay the issuance of the final action in the matter (Justice 6).  We suggest that Justice (and other agencies) explain in a little more detail the circumstances under which Aan earlier response@ might be Aappropriate@.  We are sensitive to the procedures and long history behind the Administrative Procedure Act.  However we would suggest that agencies consider adding as criteria for making an early response a demonstration by a complainant of actual harm from the agency=s dissemination of a study relied upon in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking or a demonstration by the complainant of substantial uncertainty as to whether the proposed rule will take an unusual length of time to go final.  Another interesting issue arises when an agency disseminates a particular study in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) i.e. in the context of a particular agency policy decision and a possible complainant has an interest in the study but not necessarily in the substantive policies embodied in the rulemaking.  The possible complainant may only learn that the agency has disseminated the study by reading the NPRM possibly after the comment period has expired.  Agencies need to consider how those not directly interested in the rulemaking need to submit and receive consideration of a complaint about the study.  As a general matter we urge each agency to carefully articulate the ways in which the APA NEPA and other more specific public-comment statutes meld with and thus have the apparent effect of superseding the administrative mechanisms to address public complaints provided by Section 515.  For example an agency may disseminate a risk assessment prior to publication of an NPRM.  While the agency may anticipate that this risk assessment may be used in support of the NPRM the agency should still permit complainants to file complaints under Section 515 unless the publication of the NPRM is imminent.  Such a risk assessment may have impacts beyond the scope of the rulemaking.June 10 2002OIRA REVIEW OF AGENCY DRAFT INFORMATION QUALITY GUIDELINESAdditional Quotations of Proposed Agency Provisions Organized by Topic I.  SCOPE OF AGENCY GUIDELINES.Use of Statements of AIntent@ to Delimit Scope.  SSA and NSF use Aintent@ to indicate what is covered: e.g. Astatistical or actuarial information prepared for public dissemination; reports studies and summaries prepared to inform the public@ (SSA 2 of  2; NSF 1).  Justice uses intent to exempt Aprocedural operational policy and internal manuals prepared for the management and operations of DOJ that are not primarily intended for public dissemination@ (Justice 3). Exemption for Press Releases.  FDA/HHS exempts press releases Aunless they contain new substantive information not covered by previous information dissemination@ (FDA/HHS 3).  EPA adds a different qualifier: AThese guidelines do not apply to press releases fact sheets press conferences or similar communications in any medium that announce support the announcement or give public notice of information EPA has disseminated elsewhere@ (EPA 15). State also limits the scope of the press release exemption to apply to distributions of information or other materials that are Adistributed to the press as a summary of a recent event or Department action@ (State 6).Exemption for Public Filings.  Distribution of information in public filings: Public filings include information submitted to EPA by any individual or person. ...  The guidelines do not apply where EPA distributes this information simply to provide the public with quicker and easier access to materials submitted to EPA that are publicly available. This will generally be the case if EPA has not authored the filings and is not distributing the information in a manner that suggests that EPA endorses or adopts the information and EPA does not indicate in its distribution that it is using or proposing to use the information to formulate or support a regulation guidance or other Agency decision or position (EPA 16). Exclusion For Agency Employed Scientist Grantee or Contractor. A Component does not initiate the dissemination of information when a Component-employed scientist or Component grantee or contractor publishes and communicates his research findings in the same manner as his academic colleagues even if the Component retains ownership or other intellectual property rights because the Component paid for the research.  To avoid confusion regarding whether the Component agrees with the information the researcher should include an appropriate disclaimer ... that the views expressed are his own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Component.  In contrast ... if the Component has directed a third party to disseminate information or retains the authority to review and approve the information upon release then the Component has sponsored the dissemination of the information (DOD 4).  Distribution of information by federal employees and recipients of grants cooperative agreements and contracts: These guidelines do not apply to information distributed by recipients of contracts grants or cooperative agreements unless the information is disseminated on EPA=s behalf as when EPA specifically directs or approves the dissemination. These guidelines do not apply to distribution of any type of research by federal employees and recipients of EPA grants cooperative agreements or contracts where the researcher (not EPA) decides whether and how to communicate and publish the research does so in the same manner as his or her academic colleagues and distributes the research in a manner that indicates that the research does not represent EPA=s official position (for example by including an appropriate disclaimer).  Distribution of research in this manner is not subject to these guidelines even if EPA retains ownership or other intellectual property rights because the Federal government paid for the research (EPA 15-16).  Exemption for Subpoenas or Adjudicative Processes. FMC explains this exemption succinctly: Excluded categories include: ...   Subpoenas or adjudicative processes including Commission orders opinions amicus and other briefs.  Adjudicative processes also include factual allegations by the staff during the investigative and litigation phases of cases brought by the Commission's Bureau of Enforcement.  Because there are well-established procedural safeguards and rights to address the quality of factual allegations and adjudicatory decisions and to provide persons with an opportunity to contest decisions these guidelines do not impose any additional requirements on the Commission during adjudicative proceedings and do not provide parties to such adjudicative proceedings any additional rights of challenge or appeal (FMC 7). II.  COVERAGE OF ATHIRD-PARTY@ INFORMATION UNDER THE GUIDELINES.Agencies included Athird-party@ information under the guidelines in a variety of contexts:Component dissemination of information prepared by an outside party in a matter that reasonably suggests the Component agrees with the information renders Component dissemination of the information subject to these guidelines (DOD 4).Section III mentions an important concept that may not be immediately obvious to persons reading the OMB guidelines for the first time. As Dr. John Graham Director [sic: Administrator] of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and others have pointed out in meetings about the information quality guidelines the standards for data quality that apply directly to Federal agencies also apply at least indirectly to outside parties who supply information to the Department. If the Department is to rely on technical scientific or economic information submitted by for example a commenter to a proposed rule that information would need to meet appropriate standards of objectivity and utility. Numbers submitted by a commenter as the basis for a regulatory decision B which the Department would necessarily disseminate as part of a rulemaking issuance B should meet data quality standards no less than in the case of information the Department itself generates (DOT 3). The standards of these guidelines apply not only to information that DOT generates but also to information that other parties provide to DOT if the other parties seek to have the Department rely upon or disseminate this information or the Department decides to do so (DOT 8).EPA disseminates information to the public for purposes of these guidelines when EPA initiates or sponsors the distribution of information to the public. EPA initiates a distribution of information if EPA prepares the information and distributes it to support or represent EPA=s viewpoint to formulate or support a  regulation guidance or other Agency decision or position. EPA initiates a distribution of information if EPA distributes information prepared or submitted by an outside party in a manner that reasonably suggests that EPA endorses or agrees with it if EPA indicates in its distribution that the information supports or represents EPA=s viewpoint or if EPA in its distribution proposes to use or uses the information to formulate or support a regulation guidance policy or other Agency decision or position (EPA 14).What happens if information is initially not covered by these guidelines but EPA subsequently disseminates it to the public?  If a particular distribution of information is not covered by these guidelines the guidelines may still apply to a subsequent distribution of the information in which EPA adopts endorses or uses the information to formulate or support a regulation guidance or other Agency decision or position.   For example if EPA simply makes a public filing (such as facility data required by regulation) available to the public these guidelines would not apply to that distribution of information. However if EPA later includes the data in a background document in support of a rulemaking these guidelines would apply to that later dissemination of the information in that document (EPA 17). III.  AGENCY COMMITMENT TO INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS.Performance Standards.  Some agency guidelines adopted performance standards and a commitment to meeting them.  For example  The Office of Special Counsel clearly states information quality standards as performance goals:Information should adhere to a basic standard of quality ...  Information should be objective in substance and presentation ...  Information should be responsive to its intended users ...  The integrity of information should be protected (67 FR 21318 April 30 2002).Justice draft guidelines adopt the provision from the OMB guidelines relating to performance standards (III.1).Overall agencies shall adopt a basic standard of quality (including objectivity utility and integrity) and will take appropriate steps to incorporate information quality criteria into agency information dissemination practices ...  A basic standard of quality will be ensured and established for all information prior to its dissemination (Justice 1-2 3).  Then the Justice draft sets forth a standard and commits the DOJ components to reaching it:  DOJ components will ensure disseminated information [meets the standard of objectivity] ... DOJ components will ensure information [meets the standard of integrity] (Justice 4).The Small Business Administration combines the approach taken by Justice:It is SBA=s policy to ensure and maximize the quality objectivity utility and integrity of the information that it disseminates to the public. SBA will take appropriate steps to incorporate information quality criteria into SBA=s information dissemination practices and will ensure the quality of information the agency disseminates in accordance with the standards set forth in these Guidelines. SBA is committed to integrating the principle of information quality into every step of SBA=s development of information including creation collection maintenance and dissemination. SBA will comply with all then-existing legal and policy rules regulations directives and guidance at every step of the process (SBA 4).The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission similarly sets standards and commits to reach them:  The Commission strives to present information to the public in an accurate clear complete and unbiased manner. ...  The Commission also aims to provide information that is accurate reliable and unbiased (FERC 5 6).Core Definition of AObjectivity@.  The following are concise accurate summaries of the heart of the OMB definition of Aobjectivity@:  Objectivity involves two distinct elements; presentation and substance: (A) Presentation: Disseminate information in an accurate clear complete and unbiased manner. This involves presenting information within a proper context. (B)  Substance: Focus on ensuring accurate reliable and unbiased information. In a scientific financial or statistical context generate the original and supporting data and develop the analytic results using sound statistical and research methods (Treasury 3).  Objectivity means ensuring that information is accurate reliable and unbiased and that information is presented in an accurate clear complete and unbiased manner (ERS/USDA 7).   AObjectivity@ focuses on whether the disseminated information is being presented in an accurate clear complete and unbiased manner and as a matter of substance is accurate reliable and unbiased (DOD 3). AInfluential@ and AReproducibility@.  DOT has a carefully considered discussion of influential.  Some highlights are: DOT emphasizes that to be influential information must have a clear and substantial impact. A clear and substantial impact first of all is one that the agency is firmly convinced has a high probability of occurring ... In rulemaking influential information is scientific financial or statistical information that can reasonably be regarded outcome determinative with respect to one or more key issues in a significant rulemaking as that term is defined in Executive Order 12886 ...  In non-rulemaking contexts DOT will consider two factors B breadth and intensity B in determining whether information is influential ...  DOT organizations should consider whether the information affects a broad range of parties ... DOT organizations will also consider whether the information has an intense impact.  Information that has a low cost or modest impact on affected parties is less likely to be influential than information that can have a very costly or crucial impact.  In considering whether information has a high-intensity impact DOT organizations will establish and use as a benchmark the $100 million figure used to determine whether a rule is economically significant (DOT  20-21).  Justice also has a well-considered definition of influential:  When information is defined as influential there is an added level of scrutiny afforded this information to include the need to ensure it is reproducible.  At DOJ influential information is that which is expected to have a genuinely clear and substantial impact at the national level on major public and private policy decisions as they relate to federal justice issues.  The accuracy of this information is significant due to the critical nature of these decisions.  A clear and substantial impact first of all is one that the agency is firmly convinced has a high probability of occurring.  If it is merely arguable that an impact will occur or if it is a close judgment call then the impact is probably not clear and substantial.  To determine that there is a clear and substantial impact the agency must have greater certainty than would be the case for many ordinary factual determinations.  The impact must be on """"important"""" public policy or private sector decisions that are expected to occur. Even if information has a clear and substantial impact it is not influential if the impact is not on a public or private decision that is important to policy economic or other decisions ... The """"influential"""" designation is intended to be applied to information sparingly.  DOJ components should not designate information products or types of information as influential on a regular or routine basis.  Nor should DOJ components actually place an """"influential"""" label in the title page or text of an information product (Justice  4).Both State and DOT in describing Ainfluential@ emphasize the causal link between the information itself and the effect it may have on the policy position involved: To be considered influential information must be based on objective and quantifiable data that constitute a principal basis for substantive policy positions adopted by the Department (State 6).It should also be noted that the definition applies to Ainformation@ itself not to decisions that the information may support. Even if a decision or action by DOT is itself very important a particular piece of information supporting it may or may not be Ainfluential@ (DOT 21).Analysis of Risks to Human Health Safety and the Environment.  FDA adapts the SDWA standards carefully and practically to the kinds of Risk Assessments that FDA conducts. Some of the influential information that we disseminate is based on an analysis of the risks to the public of certain actions or exposures to hazardous substances. For purposes of this guidance we are defining risk as the likelihood that injury or damage is or can be caused by a substance technology or activity. We use risk analysis (the integration of risk assessment with risk management and risk communication) as a tool to enhance the scientific basis for all of our regulatory decisions. The OMB Guidelines provide special considerations that must be taken into account in certain risk assessments those that provide the basis for the dissemination of influential information. The Guidelines state that """"With regard to analysis of risks to human health safety and the environment maintained or disseminated by the agencies agencies shall either adopt or adapt the quality principles applied by Congress to risk information used and disseminated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 (SDWA) (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(3)(A) and (B)).@ The SDWA risk assessment principles are as follows: 1. To the degree that the agency action is based on science the agency shall use a.the best available peer-reviewed science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; b.data collected by accepted methods (if reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justify use of the data). 2. In the dissemination of public information about risks the agency shall ensure that the presentation of information about risk effects is comprehensive informative and understandable. 3. In a document made available to the public in support of a regulation the agency shall specify to the extent practicable a.Each population addressed by any estimate of applicable risk effects; b.The expected risk or central estimate of risk for the specific populations affected c.Each appropriate upper-bound or lower-bound estimate of risk; d.Each significant uncertainty identified in the process of the assessment of risk effects and the studies that would assist in resolving the uncertainty; ande.Peer-reviewed studies known to the agency that support are directly relevant to or fail to support any estimate of risk effects and the methodology used to reconcile the inconsistencies in the scientific data.Many of our actions are based on scientific experts' judgments using available data are essentially qualitative and are generally carried out for non-cancer-causing hazards. Such assessments provide useful answers in most instances that are sufficient for regulatory purposes and much more elaborate quantitative estimates extrapolating beyond the data are unnecessary. For example we may issue regulations on submission requirements for product approval applications electronic submission of product labeling or periodic reporting by manufacturers of adverse events from drugs; devices; and biologics including blood vaccines and tissues. Although we analyze the economic costs of the regulations and consider alternatives regulations like these do not lend themselves to the types of quantitative risk assessments contemplated by the Safe Drinking Water Act principles. Other actions are based on research and supporting data that are generated outside FDA. For example most product approval actions are based on scientific studies conducted by sponsors seeking marketing approval in accordance with our regulations and guidance documents. Our regulations and guidance documents describe sound scientific practices for conducting human and animal studies of medical products and analyzing the resulting data. Most information in these studies is considered confidential commercial information and is closely held by the sponsors. As a result formal peer-review of the data is rare. However for certain drug approval applications the safety and/or effectiveness information is presented to scientific advisory committees for recommendations. Evaluations of food safety and nutritional data are also presented to scientific advisory committees. As a result we have adapted the general principles for risk assessments from the SDWA to fit these situations. The principles we intend to apply to risk assessments involving the dissemination of influential information affecting product approval actions or regulations that do not lend themselves to quantitative risk assessment are as follows: 1. The Agency will use a.the best available science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices including peer reviewed studies when available; and b.data collected by accepted methods (if reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justify use of the data). 2. In the dissemination of public information about risks the Agency will ensure that the presentation of information about risk effects is comprehensive informative and understandable. In situations requiring a quantitative risk assessment we generally follow basic risk assessment principles in the NAS paradigm of 1983. Our needs for quantitative risk assessments range over a wide variety of hazards including physical hazards encountered during use of a medical device food chemical residues and antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria. Thus we also ascribe to the statement from NAS when it revisited the risk assessment process in 1994 (Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment NAS 1994): """"Risk assessment is not a single process but a systematic approach to organizing and analyzing scientific knowledge and information.""""  In each of the areas we regulate we apply risk assessment practices to the specific task that are widely accepted among relevant domestic and international public health agencies. For quantitative risk assessments in support of the dissemination of influential information FDA intends to apply the following principles: 1. The agency will use- a.the best available science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; b.data collected by accepted methods (if reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justifies use of the data). 2. In the dissemination of public information about health risks the agency shall ensure that the presentation of information is comprehensive informative and understandable within the context of its intended purpose. 3. In a risk assessment document made available to the public the agency shall specify to the extent practicable- a.Each population addressed by any estimate of applicable effects; b.The expected or central estimate of risk for the specific populations affected; c.Each appropriate upper-bound and/or lower-bound risk estimate; d.Data gaps and other significant uncertainties identified in the process of the risk assessment and the studies that would assist in reducing the data gaps; and e.Additional studies not used to produce the risk estimate that support or fail to support the findings of the assessment and the rationale of why they were not used (HHS/FDA 18-20).IV.  QUALITY INTEGRAL TO CREATION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.Labor and USDA state the general principle extremely clearly: The quality assurance process should begin at the inception of the product development process (Labor 5).USDA agencies and offices will review the quality (including the objectivity utility and integrity) of information before it is disseminated and treat information quality as integral to every step of their development of information including creation collection maintenance and dissemination (USDA 3). The Small Business Administration explicitly included Ainformation development@ Ainformation acquisition@ and Ainformation maintenance@ within the scope of its information quality guidelines:When SBA develops information it will use its enterprise architecture as a guide in building the groundwork for the information. This enterprise architecture will help define the goals for the information information sharing requirements original and supporting data needs and all the applications for the information among other things. SBA will determine and document all requirements for the information (SBA 4).At the information acquisition stage SBA will remain cognizant of potential problems with information quality including accuracy currency and completeness. Wherever possible during the information acquisition process SBA will verify (assess completeness accuracy consistency currency timeliness) and validate (assess whether the data are appropriate for the measures it was collected to show) the data it collects and scrub such data to correct problems.  SBA will use lessons learned from this process to improve its information acquisition procedures. SBA also will document limitations on data and other information as a result of problems discovered during the information acquisition stage that SBA could not correct before it disseminates the information (SBA 4).SBA will make every effort within SBA=s available resources to improve the information it maintains including its data systems or processes. SBA will encourage feedback from both internal and external sources on the quality of SBA=s information and will consider making changes to its information development and acquisition procedures to correct errors and other problems. SBA will conduct information quality assessments including reviews and inspections of data comparisons with other sources of similar data and verification and validation of information and data. SBA also will take steps to ensure that the information SBA maintains remains secure from unauthorized access revision falsification or corruption (SBA 5).V.  ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANISM TO ADDRESS PUBLIC COMPLAINTS.Applicable Standards.  It is important that the administrative mechanism to address public complaints point out that agency failure to comply with either the OMB or the agency information quality standards can serve as a basis for complaint.  For example AERS  has developed administrative mechanisms to allow affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information disseminated ... that does not comply with OMB USDA or ERS Information Quality Guidelines@ (ERS/USDA 14).   By citing the OMB department and departmental component=s guidelines ERS assures compliance with all of the applicable guidelines and this provision in its guidelines is consistent with the OMB guidelines. AAffected Persons@.  HHS and its components ask the complainant to Adescribe how the person submitting the complaint is affected by the information error@ (HHS 13).  SEC invites the complainant to identify the perceived affect B Aan explanation of how the requestor is an affected person with regard to those facts or data@ (SEC 7).  SSA and FERC prevent the word Aaffected@ from having any limiting effect by not using it.  SSA and FERC make no mention of affected persons in their complaint procedures and do not require the complainant to explain how he is affected (see SSA 1; FERC 8).Information Provided to the Agency.  HHS encourages complainants to provide needed detail. ARequests for correction that are specific and provide evidence to support the need for correction will enable the agency to provide a satisfactory response@ (HHS 12). DOT takes the same approach: DOT may be unable to process in a timely fashion or at all requests that omit one or more of the requested elements. DOT will attempt to contact and work with requesters to obtain additional information when warranted (DOT 15).Decision Criteria and Burden of Proof for Resolving Complaints.   In the preamble to the OMB guidelines OMB emphasized the discretion agencies had in deciding how to resolve complaints.Overall OMB does not envision administrative mechanisms that would burden agencies with frivolous claims.  Instead the correction process should serve to address the genuine and valid needs of the agency and its constituents without disrupting agency processes.  Agencies in making their determination of whether or not to correct information may reject claims made in bad faith or without justification and are required to undertake only the degree of correction that they conclude is appropriate for the nature and timeliness of the information involved and explain such practices in their annual fiscal year reports to OMB (66 FR 49721 September 28 2001).Justice emphasizes the limits of its obligation:After it has completed its review DOJ will determine whether a correction is w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rranted and if so what corrective action it will take.  Any corrective action will be determined by the nature and timeliness of the information involved and such factors as the significance of the error on the use of the information the magnitude of the error and the cost of undertaking a correction. DOJ is not required to change or in any way alter the content or status of information simply based on the receipt of a request for correction.  The Department need not respond substantively to frivolous or repetitive requests for correction.  Nor does the Department have to respond substantively to requests that concern information not covered by the guidelines or from a person whom the information does not affect (Justice 6). State articulates the many different ways in which it may respond: Subject to applicable law rules and regulations corrective measures may include without limitation personal contacts via letter or telephone form letters press releases or postings on the Department website to correct a widely disseminated error or address a frequently raised request. Corrective measures where appropriate should be designed to provide reasonable notice to affected persons of any corrections made (State 5).Labor stresses practical constraints in correcting errors:Any structured process would not apply to an agency=s archival information or to public filings. Agencies may choose not to respond to complaints about claimed defects that are frivolous or unlikely to have substantial future impact. It may not be in the public interest for agencies to devote significant resources to correcting information where the expenditure of such resources is not in the agency=s view cost effective in light of the significance of the asserted error the benefits that are likely to be derived from such a correction the costs of the correction and the agency=s more pressing priorities and obligations (Labor 7).DOT includes economic concerns in its criteria for deciding what and how much to correct: The costs and benefits of using a higher quality standard or a more extensive review process will be considered in deciding the appropriate level of review and documentation (DOT13).  When the DOT organization determines that a correction of the information is warranted revisions/corrections to the information in question will begin as quickly as practicable. However the Department=s budget resources and priorities as well as the complexity of the correction task itself may result in DOT actually taking this corrective action within a reasonable time after the Department has made the determination that a correction is appropriate (DOT 18).DOT plans to make both the complaint and subsequent DOT responses available on the web: In the administrative correction process DOT will make extensive use of the internet accessible DMS. All requests for correction would come in the first instance to the DMS whether electronically or in hard copy. By docketing requests for correction and subsequent DOT responses in the DMS the Department will ensure the transparency of the request and response process. The DMS will also electronically notify DOT organizations of pending requests. In addition filing requests with DMS will allow other interested parties to comment about or make requests with respect to an information issue. For example suppose DOT publishes a study indicating that 75 percent of a certain kind of accident is caused by a component of a motor vehicle. Manufacturers of that component request correction of the study. Alerted to the request by the DMS posting vehicle manufacturers could respond within 30 days. The Department seeks comment on this process (DOT 3).Time Periods for Resolving Complaints and Any Appeals and Notice to the Public.  EPA takes an indirect approach to setting time limits on the filing of any complaints.  EPA exempts what it calls outdated or superseded information from being covered by the EPA guidelines: The guidelines do not apply to outdated or superseded EPA information that is provided as background information but no longer reflects EPA policy or influences EPA decisions where EPA indicates (in a disclaimer or otherwise) that the materials are provided as background materials and do not represent EPA=s current view (EPA 15).An Objective Appeals Mechanism.  HHS requires that Athe agency official who handles the original complaint will not have responsibility for resolving the appeal@ (HHS 13).  Labor requires that: The agency should generally provide that the official conducting the second level review is not the same official that responded to the initial request or from the same office that prepared the information in question. Designated agency officials may consult with other agency or Departmental offices as the agency may deem appropriate to the resolution of the complaint (Labor 6).When Interior agrees with an appeal it also takes steps to notify the public of its decision by withdrawing the information from the public domain.If at the end of the 45-day period the bureau or office determines that the complaint is without merit the complainant will be so notified.  If at the end of the 45-day period the bureau or office determines that the complaint has merit it shall so notify the complainant the appropriate program or office and it shall take reasonable steps to withdraw the information from the public domain and from any decision making process in which it is being used.  If the bureau or office determines that it will correct challenged information it will notify the complainant of its intent and the corrective steps it proposes.  The bureau or office may determine the schedule and procedure for correcting the challenged information but may not disseminate the challenged information in any form until it has been corrected.  Upon redisseminating corrected information the bureau or office will provide the complainant with a copy of the corrected information (Interior 2-3).VI.  MELDING THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 515 INTO THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF OTHER STATUTES.Treasury stated its position succinctly: Certain disseminations of information include a comprehensive public comment process (e.g. notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) regulatory analyses and requests for comment on an information collection subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act). The administrative complaint mechanism described in these guidelines does not apply to such documents. Persons questioning information disseminated in such a document must submit comments as directed in that document. An additional complaint and appeal process for information that is already subject to a public comment process is inappropriate and unfair to other public commenters who submitted timely comments (Treasury 6-7; Commerce took a similar approach Commerce 11).DOT discusses this issue thoroughly:  [T]here are some circumstances in which there is an existing process to respond to concerns expressed about the DOT=s information. The OMB guidelines encourage agencies to make use of existing processes in a flexible way tailored to their programs. When there is a sound existing process (such as a process that provides opportunities for public participation in making an agency decision) DOT organizations are asked not to duplicate that process with a separate request response mechanism.  For example when an agency issues a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) it typically describes in the preamble the basis for its proposed regulatory provisions which may include technical or scientific studies and a regulatory evaluation. In so doing it disseminates these studies or evaluations within the meaning of these guidelines. The public comment process can and often does generate views from interested persons about the soundness of the underlying information. If someone submits a request for correction pertaining to a document cited in an NPRM DOT would treat it procedurally like a comment to the rulemaking responding to it in the preamble of the final rule or a subsequent document such as a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) rather than through the separate request response mechanism of these guidelines. The content of the response would address the issues of the document=s compliance with the information quality principles of the OMB and DOT guidelines. (DOT could choose to make an earlier correction if warranted assuming so doing would not delay the issuance of the final rule.) This approach would also apply to other processes involving a structured opportunity for public participation on a proposed document before a final document is issued such as a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) an air quality conformity determination or a Section 4(f) determination under the Department of Transportation Act ...On the other hand with respect to new information appearing for the first time in a final rule or EIS DOT would consider a request for correction. The Department would not stay the final action involved. However if it appeared that the information that was the subject of the request did not comply with the guidelines and that as a result the final document was materially flawed DOT would treat the matter as a request for reconsideration. In such cases the Department would use any already existing mechanisms and procedures to reconsider corrections such as the process to petition for a new rule or to request a Supplemental EIS. The submission of a request for correction by itself does not in any way affect the finality of a decision of the Department. We believe that this approach serves the purposes of the guidelines affords an opportunity for correction of any material that does not comply with the guidelines yet does not duplicate effort or interfere with the orderly progress of DOT=s work. We seek comment on this approach (DOT 4-5).This section concerns requests for correction concerning information on which a DOT organization has sought public comment (e.g. a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) studies cited in an NPRM a regulatory evaluation or cost-benefit analysis pertaining to the NPRM; a draft environmental impact statement; a proposed policy notice or aviation order on which comment has been sought; a request for comments on an information collection subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act).The DOT organization=s response to the request for correction will normally be incorporated in the next document it issues in the matter concerning which it had sought comment (e.g. in the case of an NPRM the preamble to the final rule) DOT may choose to provide an earlier response if doing so is appropriate and will not delay the issuance of the final action in the matter. Once again the DOT organization will place their response in the DMS. As stated above ...  a DOT organization may reject a request for correction with respect to information in a final document if there was an opportunity for public comment or participation and interested persons could have requested the correction of the information at the proposed stage (DOT 18).If there is an existing process for reconsidering a particular sort of information disseminated by DOT the DOT organization will make use of that process. For example if the information relates to a final rule a DOT organization has issued and the DOT organization has an existing process for handling requests for the reconsideration of a final rule the DOT organization would use that process. If the information relates to a final EIS the DOT organization may handle the request as though it were a request for a Supplemental EIS (DOT 19). Labor included this discussion with its public notice of the complaint mechanism: This process is not intended to substitute for other legally authorized processes such as the Privacy Act or the rulemaking processes.  Concerns regarding information in a rulemaking must be presented in the rulemaking in accordance with the rulemaking=s procedures. ...  In deciding how to handle complaints agencies should be especially mindful of their legal obligations program priorities resource constraints and their duty to use resources efficiently. For example agencies have important responsibilities to issue rules and provide compliance guidance to the public. Agencies must administer the complaint and appeal process consistent with these obligations and their responsibilities to carry them out in an expeditious manner (Labor  6-7). DOT will reject a request for correction of information that could have been raised at the proposed rule stage:With respect to information in a final rule final environmental impact statement or other final document on which there was an opportunity for public comment or participation could interested persons have requested the correction of the information at the proposed stage?  If the DOT organization determines that the answer to [this] Question ... is Ayes@ DOT will reject your request (DOT 17).""",DOT-OST-2002-11996,Data Quality Clearinghouse,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2002-11996-0010,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2002-06-10T00:00:00-04:00,John Graham,Memorandum for President's Management Council,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,
7,DOT,FALSE,0,2002-08-14T23:59:59-04:00,NA,Dear Secretary MinetaWhen TEA-21 is finally reauthorized I would like to see it unambiguously require minimum funding for forms of transportation that are an alternative to the automobile; transit rail bicycling and pedestrians.  If possible I would like these forms to get the same level of funding that are now offered for construction and improvements of roads and highways.I know from bitter experience that continuing an almost-exclusive investment in roads and highways will not only fail to solve America's current transportation problems but will in fact make them worse.Until I moved to Colorado five years ago I had spent virtually my entire life in the San Francisco Bay Area.  In the 60s when I was a child the Bay Area was a place of great physical beauty with its towns and cities separated by large expanses of open space and everyone enjoying a high quality of life.  The residents of other states wanted to share that quality of life however and the state's population began to grow rapidly.I watched as the Bay Area's farms ranches forests and orchards were paved over as its cities attempted to cope with the growth by building more and larger systems of highways.  I watched the beauty and the quality of life slowly disappear.Although initially a source of pride the final result of the Bay Area's half-century investment in the automobile has been a complete disaster.  The automobile once a symbol of freedom for Americans for many has become a prison.  All of the Bay Area's state-of-the-art freeways are virtual parking lots all day long.  Commuting is a grinding nightmare for almost everyone and people are forced to organize their lives around the rhythms of traffic.  Commute times of an hour each way are not uncommon.The congestion is destroying the region's social infrastructure as well.  Desperate to avoid spending hours in their cars people are willing to pay anything to live close to where they work and have driven the cost of housing so high that a middle-class lifestyle is almost unachievable even to those with good high-paying jobs.Attempts to increase road capacity have only made the situation worse.  Theextra capacity only induces more people to use the roads so there's no improvement in the level of congestion.  Also the cost of increasing highway capacity increases at a faster rate than the capacity does so funding it becomes a larger and larger slice of the region's budget robbing more and more money from other programs like education and health care.The Bay Area is not alone in its experience.  Everywhere that it's been tried an auto-centric transportation policy has been an abject failure.  It's failed in Los Angeles Seattle Washington D.C. Atlanta Boston...basically any region that has seen an increase in population and tried to accommodate it with more roads.  They're trying it here in the Denver metro region believing that it can work here; they're wrong.The single-occupant vehicle is the least efficient most subsidized and most destructive form of transportation ever invented.  Our national investment in the automobile almost to the complete exclusion of all other forms of transportation has been a disaster for this nation.  The costs are unbelieveable; the destruction of the nation's open space severe environmental pollution reduction in our quality of life not to mention the costs of the Gulf War the War against Terrorism or finally the cost of the attack on the World Trade Center.  This nation desperately needs to make a strategic shift away from an exclusive dependence on the automobile to a transportation system that is balanced.Thanks        Michael Evans        2741 W.

During this time attempts to ""beat"" the drug test have increased significantly.  Drug abusers will go to any length to continue using therefore those who have tested positive in the past and who continue to abuse drugs are motivated by their addiction to adulterate substitute or use prosthetic-type devices to provide a ""clean"" specimen at the collection site.  Direct observation drug collections that took place prior to 8/25/08 did not effectively deter such individuals because real-looking prosthetic devices could successfully be used without detection by the observer.  Therefore I believe DOT has taken appropriate and justifiable actions to combat the problem.  Revised direct observation collection procedures create increased responsibilities for the direct observer.  Observed collections have always been awkward and will continue to be so.  Collectors and individuals they designate as observers should be given crystal clear guidance on how to conduct these collections.  DOT has made a good effort at providing guidance for collectors and observers.  Our company Alpha Pro Solutions a national drug and alcohol test training organization has taken additional steps including providing a suggested verbatim ""script"" to our clients with recommended communication and observation techniques in line with DOT requirements.  Unfortunately I believe some collection sites will gloss over the revised DOT observation regulations and will not implement proper ""update"" training of collectors.  Therefore I believe ""update"" training should be mandatory with a specific training agenda provided by DOT and a mock proficiency requirement as part of the required update training.  I believe collector role-play scenarios will greatly increase the level of professionalism and accuracy that should be exhibited by each trained collector and/or their designated observer.  I do not believe we should assume that collectors who have been ""told"" about the revised procedures have a practical understanding of how and when observed collections should be properly conducted. Regarding mandatory Return-to-Duty and Follow-Up testing observed collections I believe this requirement is prudent and appropriate given the individuals' former attempts to ""beat"" the DOT drug-free rules by either refusing to test or by providing a positive adulterated or substituted specimen.  Mandatory direct observation collections for RTD and FUP testing is truly a deterrant and in line with the intent of the Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Program.  Lastly I believe DOT should strongly consider making additional drugs of abuse (namely drugs available by prescription but abused) part of the mandatory substance abuse testing panel.

If I cannot afford that option I will be given the choice of shipping the dog in cargo or taking a later flight.  In no way does this remotely resemble a reasonable accommodation for me to be accompanied by my canine mobility aid .Please understand that I do not have a choice in the size of my assistance dog.  For reasons of my health and safety I need a Service Dog who is too big to be stuffed  under my chair in an airplane.  The ethical use of an assistance dog for tasks like balance support wheelchair pulling assistance backpacking or guiding requires the SIZE of the dog be carefully matched with a disabled handler's height and/or disability related needs.  I am mobility impaired and require a Service Dog who can physically help me do things I cannot do myself nor depend upon others to do for  me when I need these things done in a time frame for my health and safety.It does not seem fair that only passengers who are very short or those whose disability permits the use of a smaller size dog will be accommodated in the aircraft without additional charge.  As a result of the proposed rules I and others like me who must work with a larger size Service Dog will no longer have to be accommodated.What will happen to me and other disabled persons on fixed incomes who cannot afford to buy two roundtrip airline tickets instead of one?  We will be excluded from air travel which is a direct contradiction of the Air Carriers Access Act.Regarding the proposal that our Service Dogs be put in cargo as an alternative to paying for an extra seat is not a viable option for us.  Separating us from our assistance dogs would be in violation of the Americans With disabilities Act as found in Crowder v. Hawaii decision of the Ninth District court.  Shouldn't the ACAA provisions be as protective  of disabled air travelers as the ADA is of those of us using trains buses and other forms of transportation?Too many animals have died when shipped in cargo due to the temperature extremes airlines are not allowed to ship on most days during the cold weather and hot weather months.  Spring and fall would be the only times an airline might be able to offer the cargo option to me and even then only to certain destinations.The very serious reality is that neither I nor the vast majority of Assistance Dog partners I know would ever consider placing our guide hearing or service dog in cargo because of the emotional distress the separation would inflict and the risk involved.Furthermore this so called option overlooks the fact that a number of disabled persons like myself only travel alone because we know we can count on our Service Dogs in the plane cabin to assist in ways directly related to our independence dignity and safety.  Service Dogs help disabled people in many ways.  For example they may assist with transfers to the aisle chair or retrieve dropped items or provide us with immediate access to essential medical supplies in their backpacks.  For those of us who can't stand up to reach things in the overhead compartment reach the call button for the stewardess or bend down to get into a carry-on bag we have trained our Service dogs to work with us so we can extract prescription medication and a beverage to help us swallow the pills from a backpack he/she wears or another case something that can't wait for the drink cart to roll around once every two hours  when faced with symptoms such as sudden weakness dizziness throbbing pain or shortness of breath. Some of us also carry insulin shots special food or dietary supplements respiratory aids Kaopectate various types of medical equipment a fresh battery  for a T.E.N.S unit devices that monitor blood pressure or glucose levels and the list goes on depending on the individual's needs.  This is in addition to our wallet personal grooming necessities pens paper a book or other items to help us pass the time that would be unavailable to us if the dog's backpacks were put in the overhead compartment.Taking a later flight is not a realistic option either.  The airline is under no obligation to change the type of aircraft on that route to one configured to accommodate my large Service Dog and his backpack and balance/counterbalance harness to help me walk.  There is no time limit imposed on an airline like 12 hours or 36 hours before it has to find a way to accommodate me with my Service Dog in the plane cabin.Ed Eames President of the International Association of Assistance Dog Partners (IAADP) a consumer advocacy organization with more than 2000 disabled members working with guide hearing and Service Dogs has proposed the following language be adopted:""You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large Service Animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin.  If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of the leg room.  If no volunteer is forthcoming and seats are available in another class of service you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service.""Any one of the above options would be a reasonable accommodation.  Many flight attendants have related that they've never seen a Service Dog in all their years of flying until recently.  This suggestion would not be subject to abuse of the dog or the passengers involved as the dog's size and function  will be the governing factor in whether or not this sort of accommodation is necessary.There has been an industry trend over the last decade to reduce the width of the seats and the leg room for coach class passengers so more seats can be squeezed into the interior cabin to increase profits.  This reduces the floor space available for a Service Dog.  Some airlines have turned the bulkhead seating into an Exit Row which means I can't sit there with my Service Dog.  Just as worrisome I've recently learned that bulkhead seating with extra leg room is being eliminated on some of the new aircraft being built.  Shouldn't the airlines bear some responsibility for these decisions which negatively impact the amount of room in front of a seat for a Service Dog?If the DOT does not take decisive action at this time to protect the right of disabled passengers to be accommodated in the plane cabin with a Service Dog of a suitable size for the trained jobs needed to help their disabled owners it will gravely undermine the progress the Assistance Dog movement has made over the last twenty five years in the area of civil rights.Consider a person who was in tears because of not understanding an airline's demand to buy an extra seat for the necessary accompanying Service Dog or ship him in cargo.  The person assumed the airline employees were badly misinformed about the legal rights of a disabled person traveling with a Service Dog.  The only explanation is that the NPRM cites a policy that effectively guts our access rights by authorizing the airlines to charge disabled persons for an extra seat if the Service Dog intrudes into the space in front of an adjacent seat because of his/her size.The story continues with the airline learning that the person did not have enough money to buy another ticket and tried to force the person off the plane.   The passenger wouldn't go breaking down crying while trying to explain that access rights were thwarted by the flight attendant.  One of the passengers volunteered to occupy the next seat and share his leg room with the dog but the flight attendant refused to accept the passenger's offer.  She reportedly told this individual and other ticket holders in the vicinity that this [shrinking of leg room] was not allowed under the airline's rules for passengers with Service Animals.  More discussion took place.  In the end an airline employee with the authority to over rule the flight attendant agreed to this reasonable compromise and the volunteer exchanged seats with the passenger in the adjacent seat.I fear this individual's devastating experience was just the tip of the iceberg.  The flight attendant had no compunction about demanding money for an extra ticket from this disabled person or imposing a penalty if unable to pay.There will be others just as officious and hard nosed imposing their will upon disabled persons who have the assistance of a Service Dog.  It could happen to me at any given time that I  need to travel by air.  I worry that the money I painstakingly save up for these occasions may not be sufficient to have to satisfy a ""Pay up of Miss your flight"" ultimatum.If this rule is not rescinded we will face a nerve wracking future.  We will never know what to expect from an airline.  We will be extremely vulnerable to sudden financial ultimatums and to arbitrary decisions that another passenger's offer to share leg room with our Service Dog is ""against airline policy.""I ask the DOT officials involved in the rule making process to please consider adopting IAADP's recommended language outlining some common sense steps for a flight attendant to follow allowing them to provide reasonable accommodation in the plane cabin to a passenger with a large Service Dog.It simply asks the DOT to support the policy the airlines have been following for many years.  Your approval and adoption of this language will preserve our access rights and provide an equitable solution one that won't impose an unconscionable financial penalty on a disabled person for something that can't be helped: the size of Service Dog required because of one's height or disability related needs.Thank  you very much for considering my letter.SincerelyJUDITH HEISHIN SACKS",DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-0065,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-01-27T00:00:00-05:00,Judith Sacks,Judith Heishin Sacks,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Comments RE: NPR for Air Carrier Access ActThe term еТfacilityеУ should apply only to the aircraft itself and not to any parts of the airport terminals or boarding areas including ticket counters customer service counters check in gate counters jetways or other boarding devices. The ADA Accessibility Guidelines provides minimum requirements for counter heights widths of paths of travel maneuvering clearances ramp slopes etc. The regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation published to implement the requirements of the ADA provides minimum requirements for wheelchair lifts. In the years since the effective date of the Air Carrier Access Act airlines have continued to have built counters too high for use by people with disabilities. Airlines have continued to have built jetways with sections too steep for use by people with disabilities who use wheelchairs and with ramp sections (with slopes exceeding 5% for distances greater than 6 feet) lacking handrails. Violations of the ADA can be addressed by private lawsuits in federal court. There is no such right provided by the Air Carrier Access Act. By transferring the requirements for accessibility within the built environment of airports from the ADA to the ACAA this regulations will take from people with disabilities our right to enforce minimum access standards within the built environment. Historically the U.S. Department of Transportation has not been effective in addressing these issues within airport terminals. By not requiring that all flights in a routing that includes a U.S. airport for foreign aircraft flights this regulatory law will not allow people with disabilities to travel internationally on airlines other than U.S. flag carriers. If a routing is purchased with an origination and destination and with at least one stop in a U.S. airport not necessarily the origination or destination location then all flights in that routing should be required to comply with the Air Carrier Access Act. Otherwise using the example in the NPR a person might get to Germany only to be stranded in an airport by an airline refusing to transport a power wheelchair refusing to accept a service animal in the passenger cabin or refusing to provide seating accessible to a passenger with a disability. By only applying the Air Carrier Access Act to routings that have a U.S. origin or destination but not flights that have stops in the U.S. people with disabilities traveling for example to Canada through the U.S. from Europe or South America would have no right to accessible air travel. The concept of exempting foreign carrier flights that are part of a continuous routing but where there is a change of equipment and a change of flight number is simply an invitation to foreign flag airlines to change flight numbers and equipment to avoid the requirements of the Air Carrier Access Act on their routes once outside of the U.S. on flights that begin end or go through the U.S.It is suggested that waiver language specifically exclude any waivers concerning the transportation of service animals in the passenger cabin of aircraft. Some foreign flag airlines have attempted to require that all service animals be crated and transported in baggage. Some foreign flag airlines have attempted to require that all service dogs be muzzled in the passenger cabin of their aircraft. These types of regulations serve to prevent people with disabilities who are partnered with service animals from being able to fly on foreign flag airlines as they either cannot be separated from their service animals or their service dogs are unable to perform their trained tasks when muzzled.The еТdirect threatеУ language should specifically state that a person with a disability with a service animal cannot be denied air transportation or be denied having the service animal in the passenger cabin due to the animal being a direct threat unless the animal actually exhibits aggressive behavior (growling at or attempting to bite) towards a person in the airport or on the aircraft. No service animal can be deemed to be a direct threat based on the breed or size of the service animal. A service animal cannot be deemed to be a direct threat based on the size of the animal unless the service animal cannot fit into the space in front of the row of seats in which the passenger with a disability is seated with the extra depth of a bulkhead row or in any other seating row on the aircraft without protruding into a main traffic aisle of the aircraft. It is strongly suggested that the Final Rule contain specific language as to the requirements for emotional support animals. These requirements should specifically state that only people who are disabled due to a mental illness (substantially limited in the ability to engage in one or more major life activities due to a mental impairment) and not every person who has been diagnosed with a mental illness can have emotional support animals in aircraft passenger cabins. The medical documentation should specifically state that the person is disabled based on this legal standard and that a simple statement of diagnosis or a statement of disability based on the medical definition of disability is not sufficient. An airline should be required to apply for a waiver to a requirement that medical oxygen be provided on all flights with the waiver only being available when the airline can demonstrate that due to the aircraft design it is not possible to provide medical oxygen consistent with the FAA requirements. The rule should also set a fee structure for providing medical oxygen as a defined multiple of the actual costs to the airline for providing medical oxygen (such as 2 times or 3 times the actual cost to the airline). Leaving this out of a regulatory law until some future date results in this regulatory law not providing equal access to air travel to passengers with disabilities due to breathing impairments.Since the passage of the ADA there has developed a history of regulatory law and case law that prohibits businesses from charging people with disabilities based on the space such people occupy. This proposed rule would result in this being the only regulatory law that allows such additional charges. Stadiums movie theaters and other assembly facilities just as airlines earn income by the sale of seats. While a stadium may provide seats that are 18 or 20 inches wide to the general public the ADAAG requires that a seating space for a person using a wheelchair must be no less than 33 inches wide. No additional charge can be made of a person with a disability due to the additional width of a wheelchair accessible seat. Restaurants earn money based on how many tables and how many customers they can fit into their facilities. The ADAAG requires that accessible tables provide 30 inches of width for people with disabilities who use wheelchairs and that such tables be on an accessible route no less than 36 inches wide. Restaurants are not permitted to charge customers with disabilities for the extra space required to accommodate such customers. Airlines are the only entity not required to provide extra seat width to customers with disabilities who use wheelchairs. It is more than fair that airlines be required to provide a minimum width to passengers with disabilities not all people who are obese but those who are еТsubstantially limitedеУ and to only be able to charge an extra fee when the passenger needs a seating width that exceeds this minimum requirement. It is suggested that the standard used in the ADAAG be used in this rule with an additional charge only being allowed when the passenger requires a seating width exceeding 30 inches. The Departments еТlong standingеУ rule has shown to have the end result of denying equal access to air travel for people with disabilities who are unable to fit into a 16 to 18 inch wide seat and should not be carried forward into the new rule.Until such time as this rule is amended to address new technology for providing information at gates that is accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing the rule should require that airline gate personnel will directly provide information provided in an audible format by public address to any passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing and who request such assistance and who are seated within the gate area when an announcement is made.It the final rule allows two years for existing airline websites to be accessible to people who are blind an excessive delay then the final rule should require that any airline with an inaccessible website that offers lower ticket prices or waives any ticketing fees to internet customers offer those same lower prices or waiver of ticket fees to passengers who purchase tickets by telephone and who self identify as being blind or disabled due to a visual impairment.As to providing a means to request accessibility services through a website this should not apply to requesting bulkhead seating or seating with additional leg room for passengers with disabilities who qualify for such seating. Based on the history of people committing fraud to obtain what they believe to be better seating (in sports facilities and concert facilities in addition to in air travel) such requests should be made by telephone when appropriate questions can be asked of the passenger to verify that the passenger qualifies for such seating.The availability of the regulatory law should require that this material be provided in print (including alternative formats) and not just on the computers of the airline. There is a history of at least one major airline only having 14 CFR Part 382 on their computers not allowing the passenger to go behind the counter to see the computer screen and only printing out very limited parts of the regulatory law thereby not giving the passenger access to this information. Based on this history of abuse by one of the largest U.S. flag airlines a very explicit rule is needed.The time frame for accessibility in foreign airports seems to be reasonable but as stated above the requirements of Titles II and III of the ADA including the ADAAG should apply to all airline leased and/or operated elements of the built environments of airports in the U.S. Electronic ticketing kiosks should be accessible to people with disabilities including those who use wheelchairs and those who are blind. In addition to providing operating controls within reach ranges usable by people using wheelchairs the video displays of these devices should be required to be at a height and at an angle that makes the visible and readable to people who are seated in wheelchairs. Just as ATMs now provide audible information for those people unable to see these kiosks should be equipped to provide equal access to people who are blind or disabled due to visual impairments. Many airlines perform additional security screening at the gates prior to or during boarding. This rule should address a specific issue that of searching wheelchairs. If a wheelchair is to be searched with the person required to transfer from the wheelchair a transfer station with a fixed seat and fixed grab bars meeting the ADAAG requirements for grab bars at water closets (ADAAG section 4.16.4) should be provided with a screen that can be put in place as requested for privacy during the transfer. While recognizing the regulatory authority issue this requirement should also apply to airport security screening areas when a transfer is required.While there is no reason to provide movable armrests on aisle seats of rows where passengers with disabilities may not sit there is no basis for excluding those rows when determining the number of aisle seats that must have movable armrests. Since the rule requires that only 50% of aisle seats must have movable armrests the rows that are not available based on FAA rules for passengers with disabilities would be part of the 50% of aisle seats without movable armrests. By excluding those seats from the count of seats on which the number of seats accessible to people with disabilities is calculated this will simply reduce for no reason the availability of accessible aisle seats.There is full agreement that there is no foundation for any type of seat being excluded from the requirement for movable armrests. The major airlines have used the failure to require 50% of seats including all seat types to engage in intentional discrimination against people with disabilities. The seats that never have movable armrests are those seats where the airline does not want passengers with disabilities. With the exception of one or two airlines no airline has provided movable armrests in business class or first class cabins. With no exceptions no airline has provided movable armrests on bulkhead aisle seats seats in high demand by business travelers and travelers with infants even though 14 CFR Part 382 requires that bulkhead seating be provided to passengers with disabilities with immobilized leg joints and those with service animals. The airlines have simply used the lack of specific language concerning this issue to deny necessary seating to passengers with disabilities so that have these seats available for their business travelers.The failure to require accessible lavatories on aircraft with only one aisle has resulted in many people with disabilities being unable to travel by air. People with bladder and/or bowel issues that are part of their disabling impairments continue to be denied equal access to air travel due to the lack of aircraft with accessible lavatories. The requirement for accessible lavatories should not be based on the number of aisles of an aircraft but on the seating capacity of the aircraft. The Department should determine the number of seats lost to the provision of an accessible lavatory and should then determine at what number of seats the loss of that number of seats would not result in an undue financial burden. This commenter suggests that in aircraft with 200 or more seats that an accessible lavatory should be provided.The dimensions for the space for storing a folding wheelchair in the passenger cabin of aircraft is not sufficient for many folding wheelchairs. The standard clear floor space requirement for a stationary wheelchair is 30 inches wide and 48 inches deep. When a wheelchair is folded the width is reduced but not the length. Therefore the dimensions should be the 13 inch width and the 36 inch height but the length should be increased from 42 inches to 48 inches. Additionally the dimensions should be stated as width length and height so that airlines do not attempt to provide a space that is only 36 inches long but 48 inches high. An alternative of strapping a folding wheelchair into seats and bumping passengers as necessary is not a reasonable alternative to providing an actual storage space for a folding wheelchair. This opinion is based on the history of airlines violating the requirements of the Air Carrier Access Act in the past. If an airline was to refuse to provide this alternate folding wheelchair storage location claiming that the seats are sold the passenger with a disability will be confronted with a choice of not flying on the scheduled flight or risking damage to the wheelchair placed in baggage. Airlines are well known to give people seeking a CRO for assistance the choice of deplaning and missing the flight or accepting the violation of their rights. Anything that replaces a built in means of compliance with a staff provided means of compliance simply invites violations.The intent of the existing regulation concerning passengers with a fused or immobilized leg was never to have that passenger extend his/her leg into the main aisle of the aircraft. The existing rule requires bulkhead seating or other seating with additional leg room. Extending a leg into the main aisle is not effective places the passenger with a disability at risk of injury and impacts on the use of the aisle by the cabin crew and by other passengers. Additionally many people with disabilities have both legs fused or immobilized making it impossible for such people to fly if the only additional leg room is provide by having a leg extended into an aisle. A person unable to bend a leg to fit into the space of a standard seat cannot magically bend that leg during take off and landing when the FAA requires that the main aisle be clear of obstruction. That person cannot magically develop the ability to bend that leg when beverage and food service carts require the full width of the aisle be clear. Extending an already damaged leg into the aisle invites injury as passengers walk into the extended leg The regulation should require that bulkhead seating or other seating with additional leg room be provided for passengers with disabilities with fused or immobilized legs. When an airline chooses through aircraft cabin configuration design to not provide any accessible bulkhead seating with additional leg room or any other seating with additional leg room then the rule should require that the airline provide without additional charge either a business class or first class seat that does have additional leg room or two adjacent coach class seats so that the passenger has the additional needed leg room by sitting at an angle and using the foot space of the two seats. An airline can be relieved of this financial burden simply by providing accessible bulkhead seating that has extra leg room. The existing regulation with the addition of specifying which side of the aircraft aisle the person is seated DOES NOT resolve the problem faced by people with fused or immobilized legs.There is no question that the existing rule that allows airlines to refuse to place passengers with disabilities in business class or in first class when the passenger cannot be accommodated in coach class has resulted in extensive discrimination against passengers with disabilities. Airlines have chosen to eliminate accessible bulkhead seating by combining bulkhead seating with exit row seating thereby eliminating coach seating with space for people with service animals and seating with space for people with fused or immobilized leg joints. Airlines should be required to provide business class seating or first class seating for passengers with service animals and for passengers with fused or immobilized leg joints on aircraft that do not provide coach seats with extra leg room. The regulation should be specific as to how much extra leg room is required in a row of coach seats to relieve the airline of the requirement to provide business class or first class seating at no additional cost to the passenger with a disability. As stated previously passengers with disabilities who are too large to fit in a standard coach seat should be provided with a wider seat up to 30 inches in width either by providing such passengers with two coach seats or by seating such passengers in business class or first class if such seats provide a sufficient width. Safeguards for abuse are not a significant issue. The passenger with fused or immobilized leg joint(s) should be required to either demonstrate that the immobilization exists or provide medical documentation of such immobilization. As for those with service animals and those too large to fit in a single coach class seat the issue requiring business class or first class seating is obvious. Since the business class or first class seating requirement is linked to the airlineеХs decision to not provide seating in coach class that is usable by such people these passengers should not be excessively burdened with documentation requirements.Arriving passengers with disabilities seeking assistance at the ticket counter should not be required to request such assistance in advance. Only if passengers with disabilities are seeking assistance prior to reaching the ticket counter such as for transporting baggage from the parking garage or at curb side baggage checking locations should it be appropriate for airlines to seek advance notice of no more than 24 hours.In order for people with disabilities to be able to make connecting flights we cannot be excessively delayed in deplaning. Airlines typically refuse to deplane passengers needing to use an aisle chair until all other passengers have deplaned. This practice should be unlawful. The regulation should require that passengers with disabilities be deplaned at the same time as passengers seated in the rows adjacent to that passenger are able to deplane. Therefore a passenger with a disability seated near the rear of the aircraft with the exits at the front of the aircraft would be deplaned when most other passengers had already deplaned but a passenger with a disability seated near the front of the aircraft with front of aircraft exits would be deplaned prior to those seated further back in the aircraft. Many passengers flying with limited connecting time choose seats that facilitate prompt deplaning. This same ability should be available to passengers with disabilities including those who require the assistance of an aisle chair when boarding and deplaning.Concerning the stowage of power wheelchairs in the baggage compartment regulatory language is needed that prohibits the disassembly of power wheelchairs where the batteries are clearly marked as non-spillable (meeting FAA requirements) and where the connection between the batteries and the motors can be disconnected by a key switch or by unplugging a power cord. Several airlines most notably American Airlines frequently disassemble power wheelchairs claiming that the batteries have to be disconnected at the battery terminals regardless of other means of isolating the battery power from the motors of the wheelchair.  When a wheelchair is disassembled the regulation should clearly state that the airline is responsible for reassembling the wheelchair. The regulation should suggest or require that the airline employee who disassembles the wheelchair provide written information as to how the wheelchair was disassembled to aide the airline employee at the arrival location in the reassembly of the wheelchair.Baggage liability should include a requirement that when a mobility device is damaged by an airline an equivalent mobility device must be provided within one hour of arrival and the recognition that the mobility device has been damaged. Providing a 45 pound manual wheelchair to a person who can only push an ultra light wheelchair or to a person in a power assist manual wheelchair or a power wheelchair does not restore the mobility to that person that has been taken away by the damage done to the personеХs mobility device. The regulation should provide the airlines with a choice of having on hand a variety of types of wheelchairs for temporary replacement of damaged wheelchairs or have a contracts with a local wheelchair companies that provides for a variety of temporary replacement wheelchairs to be available during all hours of airline operations at each airport from which the airline operates.There is no question that the current training of airline personnel and contract employees is inadequate. At this time only passengers with disabilities who are knowledgeable as to their rights under the Air Carrier Access Act have any chance at all of not having their rights violated. Ticketing agents on the telephone rarely know of the rules for accessible seating and often refuse to provide seat reservations currently required by the regulations. Agents at ticket counters are typically not educated in these areas either. Gate agents typically do not know the regulatory requirements and often do not even know who the CRO is for their airline. Training of all airline employees who have contact with the public specific to the issues that each employee addresses should be required in detail in these regulations. For example reservation staff should be trained as to the seating requirements. Ticket counter staff should be trained as to seating requirements and airport assistance requirements. Requiring overall and generalized training of the ACAA requirements of all employees simply results in employees not receiving sufficient detailed training of the ACAA issues relevant to their customer interactions.As far as complaints made to CROs the regulations should require that the passenger whose complaint has not been resolved be provided with written documentation of the complaint at the time the complaint is made unless the request for the CRO was made by the passenger less than 15 minutes prior to the scheduled departure of the aircraft on which the passenger is traveling. Airlines especially American Airlines have typically refused to provide any on the scene documentation and then when documentation of the complaint is mailed to the passenger some days or weeks later the information is incorrect and tends to minimize the discriminatory actions of the airline. Only by providing documentation at the time of a violation of the rights of a passenger with a disability can there be any hope of truthfulness on the part of the airlines.The language addressing emotional support animals for people with disabilities due to mental illness should be improved to include that the documentation from the mental health professional specifically identify the major life activity from which the person is substantially limited. The vast majority of people who suffer mental illness do not meet the ACAA/ADA definition of disability which requires a substantial limitation of the ability to engage in one or more major life activities. (It should be noted that no court has determined that the ability to travel by air is a major life activity.) Fundamental to the determination of disability is that such determination is not based on diagnosis but on the impact of an impairment. A doctorеХs letter that provides a diagnosis does not establish that the person is disabled under the standards of this law. The regulatory language should also include a provision that seating with additional floor space for a service animal shall be provide on a priority basis to people with disabilities with service animals and only provided to people with emotional support animals when there is no need for such seating by a person with a service animal. It should be noted that service animal users specifically service dog users have great concerns about large numbers of people with poorly trained emotional support animals being allowed on aircraft. Many of these dogs prove to be dog aggressive while service dogs are typically trained to never show aggression. A confrontation between a dog aggressive emotional support dog and a non-aggressive service dog can result in permanent harm to the service dog who might then be unable to work effectively around other dogs. Additionally with airlines designing cabins with very little space for service animals a broad inclusion of people with mental illnesses who are not disabled but who wish to travel with their emotional support dogs creates an uncomfortable competition for the limited available space. If it is the desire of DOT to broadly define the class of people with emotional support dogs who can bring their dogs into the passenger cabins of aircraft then DOT should also require additional seats in aircraft that have the floor space for such dogs without creating a competition through scarcity. AS TO SERVICE ANIMALS AND SEATING:The regulatory language concerning service animals specifically the language concerning service animals fitting under a seat is wholly inadequate and will result as has been the case since this language was published in a DOT guidance in people with disabilities with service animals being denied transportation by airlines. Nowhere in the existing regulation is there a requirement that service animals fit under the seat in front of a passenger with a disability. In fact the existing regulations require that bulkhead seating be provided to passengers with disabilities with service animals. The Department clearly recognized at that time that most service animals could never fit under a seat in an airplane (at a time when seats were significantly wider than is now the case). Guide dogs for people who are blind are typically dogs weighing from 60 to 100 pounds a size necessary for them to perform the tasks needed by people who are blind. Mobility assistance dogs are typically as large or larger than guide dogs as they must be able to perform tasks such as pulling people in wheelchairs bracing people for transferring and providing balance assistance to people with mobility impairments who are ambulatory. It is impossible for most 75 pound or larger guide dog or most 90 to 120 pound mobility assistance dog that pulls a person in a wheelchair to fit in the 16 or 17 inch wide space under a seat in an airplane.The problem of space for service animals has increased dramatically due to decisions by airlines that have reduced the accessibility of their aircraft in violation of the requirements of the ACAA. Each time an aircraft with an accessible coach bulkhead row (a bulkhead row that is not an exit row) has been replaced with an aircraft having no coach bulkhead row or with all coach bulkhead rows being exit rows the airline has reduced the accessibility of their fleet. Such changes should be prohibited unless other regulatory language requires usable and effective alternatives to providing accessible bulkhead rows. When an accessible bulkhead row in a row of three seats has 10 inches of additional foot and leg space than at other rows then this space can be occupied by a service animal without taking from other passengers the foot and leg space that would be available in other rows of seats. Using the all too typical 16 inch wide seat this would provide a space 48 inches long by 10 inches wide for the service animal (actually more space than that is provided as a width of 16 inches for a seat does not include the width of the armrests). With the service animal also being able to occupy some of the foot and leg space of the person traveling with the service animal most service animals can be accommodated. Since the existing regulatory law required that bulkhead seating be provided any change in the regulatory law that does not require the amount of floor space detailed above (10 inches by 36 inches in rows with 2 seats 10 inches by 48 inches in rows with 3 seats) represents a reduction of accessibility and is unacceptable. In order to comply with the Congressional mandate this regulatory law must insure that people with disabilities with service animals do have equal access to commercial air travel. This regulatory change does not provide this access. What should be required is that airlines either provide accessible coach bulkhead seating with additional leg and foot space that can accommodate service animals or if the airline chooses to not provide accessible coach bulkhead seating the airline must provide an empty seat next to the passenger with the service animal or must seat the passenger with the service animal in a business class or first class seat that provides the necessary floor space. Only when a service animal cannot fit in the space that should be provided in an accessible bulkhead row (10 inches by 48 inches plus the foot space of the person traveling with the service animal) should the airline be allowed to require the service animal to travel in cargo or baggage because of the size of the service animal. It is unacceptable to allow airlines to eliminate seating areas that were designated for priority use by people with disabilities with service animals (and people with disabilities with fused or immobilized legs) and to then make the airlinesеХ decisions the burden of people with disabilities. Air,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ines have every right to design their aircraft interiors as they wish within the limitations of FAA requirements. However they do not have the right to create and build interior designs that ignore the rights of passengers with disabilities. Congress mandated that people with disabilities have equal access to air travel and the DOT has been charged with making this Congressional desire a reality. In order to meet the requirements of the ACAA this regulatory law must insist that airlines provide the space needed by passengers with disabilities who wish to travel by air. If the FAA approves and the public accepts seats that are 16 inches wide then airlines can use these very narrow seats. But they should not then be allowed to force people who due to disability require more space to pay for a larger seat in business class or first class or to purchase two seats. With the approval of the FAA airlines have the right to eliminate bulkhead rows and to combine bulkhead rows with exit rows. It is my opinion that by allowing these changes in the face of the ACAA requirements for bulkhead seating for specific subgroups of people with disabilities that the DOT has allowed airlines to violate the ACAA. This design flexibility should not be allowed to be used to remove from aircraft the floor space needed by travelers with disabilities with service animals and travelers with disabilities with legs that do not bend. The narrower seats have the purpose of increasing airline revenue by allowing more seats to fit into an aircraft. The elimination of accessible bulkhead rows allows airlines to increase the number of seats that can be sold again the purpose is to increase airline revenue. It is not unreasonable for airlines to have to assume some costs associated with these revenue enhancing changes. Whether the cost imposed on the airlines is providing an extra seat without charge to a person with a disability with a service animal (or a person with a disability too large to fit in a too narrow seat) or upgrading that person to business class or first class where the seats are wider and where more leg and foot space is provided that should simply be part of the cost of doing business in the face of revenue enhancing aircraft interior design changes. It is shocking that the DOT mandated by Congress to regulate the airline industry in a manner that provides equal access to air travel for people with disabilities seems more interested in protecting the revenue stream of the airlines at the expense of equal access. The NPRM if it was to become a final rule will prevent many people with disabilities who are unable to afford two coach seats or a business class or first class seat any access to air travel. People with disabilities with legs that cannot bend will be forced to purchase more expensive seats or two coach seats or they simply will not be able to fly. People with disabilities with service animals will be forced to purchase seats in more expensive classes or to purchase two seats. Those with disabilities who cannot afford to pay more than is required of any other passengers will simply be denied air travel. Of the more than 2000 people with disabilities with service dogs I know of no person who would place their service dog at risk by having their service dog flown in a baggage or cargo compartment. As I have stated above the changes in aircraft cabin design that have eliminated accessible seating for people with disabilities with service animals and people with disabilities with legs that do not bend are changes made to enhance airline revenue. The only reasonable response to those changes is for this regulatory law to impose on the airlines the cost of accommodating people with disabilities who have faced this reduction in accessibility. The only alternative to imposing these costs on the airlines rather than making this a burden placed on people with disabilities is for the regulations to require accessible bulkhead seating in all classes of service with specific dimensions for the extra leg and foot space provided at these required bulkhead seating rows.

14,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-02-11T23:59:59-05:00,NA,As the spouse of a disabled person who depends on a handicapped service dog full time I am greatly concerned about the regulatory language referring to Seating Accommodations in the Plane Cabin for Disabled Persons with Assistance dogs.I object to the language int the DOT's NPRM that grants the airlines the right to charge a disabled passenger for an extra seat put the dog in cargo or make the team get off the plane if the service animal cannot fit in the small space allotted directly in front of the passenger's seat.  Some of the reasons for my objection include:1.  Purchasing a second seat is not a viable option since the additional costs would exclude most disabled people with large dogs from traveling by air. It would place an undue financial burden on them. A frequently cited statistic is that 70% of the 54 million Americans with disabilities are unemployed and more than 40% rely on the federal welfare program. Disabled Americans constitute the most economically deprived segment of the population. Finally if a flight is fully booked how would being charged for a second seat solve the problem? 2. Traveling on a later flight does not guarantee the issue will be resolved since the same circumstances may exist on the later flight. The prospect of being forced to delay the trip missing connections pick up times and appointments would be a huge disincentive to air travel. My wifes disability already requires us to make special arrangements for transportation.  Our onward arrangements often are not flexible enough to handle a change to a later possible day(s) later flight.  3.  Shipping the assistance dog in cargo due to the risk of trauma or loss is an option unacceptable to IAADP assistance dog partner members. Such a separation was declared to be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Crowder case against the state of Hawaii. I request that the DOT not implement the proposed change.  The grudging inconvenient and sometimes ineffective implementation of the current rules by the airlines we fly can only be worsened by giving the airlines more ways in which to fail to serve disabled customers.I support the language proposed by the IAADP:You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin. If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room. If no volunteer is forthcoming and seat are available in another class of service you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service.SincerelyTodd Harrison,DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-0148,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-02-11T00:00:00-05:00,Todd Harrison,Todd I.

Room PL-401Washington DC 20590Docket Number: OST-2004-19482-9My name is Tim De Vargas and I am a concerned citizen who admires the work performed by guide hearing and service dogs.  I am also a disabled partner who gained independence or an increase in safety or mobility thanks to the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) giving access rights to disabled individuals.  Additionally I worked in the Civil Rights arena with regard to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which provided for non-discriminatory practices by any entity that receives federal funds or provided public benefit.  Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries are at risk of losing their federally guaranteed right under the U.S. Constitution and many many Civil Rights laws.  The proposed rule grants airlines the right to require a passenger with an assistance dog to purchase a second ticket if the canine assistant is not small enough to fit in the floor space directly in front of the passenger's seat. Alternatively airlines may require the passenger to ship the dog in cargo or wait for a later flight. I do not believe this proposed policy is ""a reasonable accommodation"" for those of us traveling with assistance dogs. It penalizes disabled people working with large dogs for physical support guidance or wheelchair pulling. Even smaller dogs wearing backpacks containing medical supplies and equipment required by the disabled passenger may not fit into this space.I believe this inclusion of new regulatory language would violate the spirit of the Air Carrier Access Act which Congress passed to ensure the airlines would increase the accessibility of air travel to the disabled population.  This is also a Prima Face violation of Title VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ADA the Age Discrimination Act of 1972 the Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act of 1975 as well as potentially many more statutes and Executive orders.  1.Purchasing a second seat is not a viable option since the additional costs would exclude most disabled people with large dogs from traveling by air.

Such a separation was declared to be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Crowder case against the state of Hawaii. The proposed language must be removed and alternative policies must be developed.  The airline industry has made great strides in securing its passengers in light of the events of 911.   To remove the rights of Americans would only serve to further the efforts of terrorists.  When a fundamental right is taken we can only concern ourselves over our Civil Rights in total!  How can it be that assistive animals and their dependents (the disabled) be treated with such overt discrimination as a targeted group of a protective class?I amTim M. De VargasP.O.

Room PL-401Washington DC 20590February 13 2005Docket Number: OST-2004-19482-9Dear sirs:I am a disabled individual who relies on a service dog to assist me with mobility issues. My current dog a 90 pound Bouvier has been my working partner for nearly six years now and without his help my independence would be severely compromised. With my service dog's help I've been able to travel independently by airplane for business and pleasure. These trips would not have been possible without my service dog.While some people with certain disabilities can use small dogs to assist them those of us who require help with mobility balance or gait problems simply need to have large dogs who are tall enough so that we can reach the harnesses they wear and are stout enough to provide the counterbalance weight we need. Those of us who have a tendency to fall need dogs who are strong enough to help us get back to our feet. While a Chihuahua or Toy Poodle might be more convenient for the airlines when we travel those breeds would not be able to perform the tasks we actually need.The new language in the DOT's Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) that grants the airlines the right to charge a disabled passenger for an extra seat put the dog in cargo or make the team get off the plane if the service animal cannot fit in the small space allotted directly in front of the passenger's seat is of great concern to me because it violates the very civil rights that the ADA was designed to protect.The DOT has apparently not proposed charging a disabled person for an extra seat if their cane or walker or wheelchair will not fit into the small space directly in front of the passenger's seat nor has it been suggested that walkers wheelchairs or canes be placed in the cargo hold. I saw no language that suggested that disabled people should get off the plane if their walker or cane or wheelchair does not fit under the seat in front of them either. The current DOT language suggests strapping wheelchairs into an empty row to secure them and even a large service dog does not require that much space.Service dogs are considered as assistive devices for disabled people under the ADA Title III regulations and so the DOT should not be allowing the airlines to put restrictive limitations on the access of people with disabilities who use guide dogs or service dogs.Neither did I see language that would charge non-disabled passengers for an extra seat boot them off the plane or take items to cargo if their carry on garment bags did not fit into the small space under the seat in front of them. I've often seen flight attendants offer to hang these bags in other closets in the plane. If these non-disabled passengers can be accommodated so easily then it seems reasonable that a disabled passenger with a service dog should be accommodated as well.Most of the time when I've flown with my dog there have been empty seats in the plane and the gate attendant has simply blocked out an extra seat next to me. My dog's head and shoulders are under my feet and his rear end is in front of the empty seat near the window. Another passenger can occupy the aisle seat and not be impacted by my dog at all.On occasions when the planes have been fairly full the attendants have simply announced that ""We have a passenger on the plane today who is traveling with a large service dog. If you would not mind sharing a row with a large dog please press your overhead Call button."" Typically lights go on all over the plane and on several occasions passengers have arranged to take turns so that they can each have a chance to meet my dog and ask a million questions. On several other flights where an extra seat had not been blocked out for my dog the flight attendants have offered someone in my row seating in first class if they'll move. No one has refused and usually they thank me.<G>Only one time have I been on a flight where every seat on the plane had been sold. On that flight there was a woman in the row ahead of me who was traveling with two young children. She offered to have her little daughter sit in the middle seat in my row since she did not need any leg room and that worked out well. The flight attendant surprised the mother with some sort of thank you perq and she also had me to entertain her child during the flight.The only issues I've had when traveling have been with a few ticket agents when I've checked my bags who have commented ""Lady I don't know where you think you're going to fit that big dog on the plane."" The reality is that the flight attendants always seem to be able to easily work out the details once we get to the plane by seating me in a less than full row or offering to upgrade seating for another passenger in the row. My experience has consistently been that the flight attendants and other passengers are generally understanding and supportive when I've travelled with my service dog. I've never heard anyone complain about having a dog on the plane.... quite the contrary most people compliment my dog's quiet demeanor and excellent manners and most people on the plane do not even realize that there was a dog on the flight until we get up to exit the plane.I would encourage the Department of Transportation to thoughtfully reconsider whether these proposed language changes faithfully protect the rights of disabled passengers as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act or are simply meant to create an illegal loophole to allow the airline industry to discriminate against people with disabilities. If language changes are necessary then I would suggest that this wording be added:       ""You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin. If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room. If no volunteer is forthcoming and seats are available in another class of service you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service.""I also have to question what the impact of the proposed changes would be in terms of efficiency and additional income for the airlines. When I've traveled through airports it's rare for me to see even one other service or guide dog in the terminal. I can't recall ever seeing another service or guide dog on a flight with us. It's difficult for me to believe that the airlines are being so negatively impacted by large service dogs that changes are even needed and the very suggestion that these changes are necessary seems to me to be much ado about nothing.On the other hand charging a disabled individual two fares simply because they have a large service dog seems to be mean spirited and excessive. Many disabled people are unable to work as a result of their disabilities so are already living on very limited incomes. Many already incur substantial medical bills as a result of their disabilities and unless they have a working spouse who can cover them face serious difficulties obtaining medical insurance. To further penalize these people by charging an airline fare for their service dogs (in violation of the existing ADA regulations) strikes me as incredibly insensitive.Sincere regardsSue MatthewsHillsboroOR",DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-0159,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-02-14T00:00:00-05:00,Sue Matthews,Sue Matthews ,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although he only weighs 19 pounds fitting fully under a seat in many cramped planes is not possible.  My husband's 45 pound service dog certainly cannot fit fully under the seat ahead of him.  Many people have service dogs that are larger than that (German Shepherds Golden Retrievers etc.).  The informal arrangements currently used by the airlines have worked well.  It is imperative that the proposed changes not be enacted.  If they are the airlines will be making public transportation inaccessible to many people with disabilities.  The informal arrangements have constituted a successful reasonable accomodation for certain disabilities.  Not only would the proposed changes be morally wrong they would surely be a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act and swiftly end up in court.,DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-0207,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-02-16T00:00:00-05:00,Donna Dykstra,Donna M.

24,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-02-16T23:59:59-05:00,NA,The  language recommended in the NPRM suggests that the disabled passenger  could be charged for an extra seat asked to take a later flight or have  the assistance dog shipped in cargo are seen as threats by members of the  assistance dog partner community to their ability to travel by air. The  three  options cited in the NPRM would have a devastating impact on air  travel by  assistance dog partners because: 1. Purchasing a  second seat is not a viable option since the additional  costs would  exclude most disabled people with large dogs from traveling by air. It  would place an undue financial burden on them and would be seen as an  overt form of discrimination. A frequently cited statistic is that 70% of  the 54 million Americans with disabilities are unemployed and more  than 40% rely on the federal welfare program. Disabled Americans constitute the  most economically deprived segment of our nation's population. Finally if a  flight is fully booked how would being charged for a second seat solve the  problem?2. Traveling on a later flight does not guarantee the issue will  be  resolved since the same circumstances may exist on the later  flight.3. Shipping the assistance dog in cargo is a totally unacceptable  option  for IAADP assistance dog partner members. A number of comments  already submitted have indicated such separation was declared a violation  of the Americans with  Disabilities Act by the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals in the Crowder case against the state of  Hawaii. That this  option is even suggested by DOT is an indication of a lack of  understanding of the work performed by guide hearing  and service dogs and  the relationship of these canine assistants to their disabled partners.  Please consider the ramifications for the disabled.RespectfullyMary Mazzeri Professional Dog Trainer,DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-0200,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-02-16T00:00:00-05:00,Mary Mazzeri,Mary Mazzeri ,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
25,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-02-17T23:59:59-05:00,NA,As a frequent flyer with MS I am appalled that the airlines have to be sued to end the purposeful discrimination they practice with disabled passengers.  As a frequent flyer I know that this discrimination exists.  Every time I fly with every airline I encounter problems.   The worst occurrence was when I traveled from St. Louis to Oakland and the airline broke my 72 pound electric scooter.  It even has wheels and a strap with which to pull it.  When they presented it to me after pulling it up the stairs bump by bump I noticed immediately that it was broken.  It was impossible for me to pull it and I asked for some help to get it down to my friendеХs Land Rover.  The airlineеХs assistants said that they could not help me with it due to еТliability issues.еУ  I was forced to drag it until I found a luggage cart and took it to the baggage carousal.  So youеХre thinking еТWell if she could do it what is the big deal?еУ  The big deal is that MS has stripped the insulation from the nerves in my feet and walking causes terrible pain much like an exposed tooth nerve.  MS also causes me to suffer from terrible fatigue.  That walk to the baggage carousal caused me terrible pain and made me too tired to visit with my friend whom I hadnеХt seen in decades.  Every trip I take my scooter on causes damage to my $1300 scooter in some way.  Damage that I have to pay for.  My insurance company (Blue Cross/Blue Shield) doesnеХt cover electric scooters for MS.  They donеХt care if I travel either.  Sometimes I donеХt need to take my scooter and then I encounter problems getting a wheelchair.  IеХve been told that theyеХre too busy or that itеХs not that far.  Sure I look healthy and IеХm only 52 but itеХs not for the airline employees to decide if I can walk.  All I want is a little help and a little respect for the equipment I need to travel.  Airline travel is often the only way the disabled can travel because itеХs a quick way to get from point A to point B.  Other methods are often too fatiguing or physically impossible.  What the airlines need to remember is why they are in business.  With the aging of the baby boomers the airlines are going to be in trouble if they alienate that growing segment of wealthy older travelers that may have more mobility issues than the younger travelers.  In 1994 13 percent of the national population was age 65 or older and by 2050 they will constitute 20 percent of the total population.  According to the Travel Industry Association of America baby boomers generated more travel than any other group and spend more on their trips than other age groups.  It doesnеХt make good business sense to alienate that segment of the population by not catering to their possible special needs.  It should not be necessary to sue an industry to get it to provide the accommodations for passengers that they need in order to survive in todayеХs market. ,DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-0228,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-02-17T00:00:00-05:00,Eileen Queen,Eileen K.

26,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-02-17T23:59:59-05:00,NA,"Comments RE: NPR for Air Carrier Access Act The regulations should require a minimum of eight feet of aisle length to be a minimun of 32 inches in width from the bulkhead to  provide access to aisle seating with flip back arm rests.  This will allow persons using wheelchairs to approach the seating without having to transfer to an aisle chair.  Transferring to aisle chairs is extremely hazardous for many people who use wheelchairs.  As well most people who use wheelchairs cannot transfer independently to the aisle chair and must be lifted by airport or airline personnel causing possible injury to the personnel. By simply widening the aisle many injuries to both passengers and personnel will be eliminated.  The term ""facility"" should apply only to the aircraft itself and not to any parts of the airport terminals or boarding areas including ticket counters customer service counters check in gate counters jetways or other boarding devices. The ADA Accessibility Guidelines provides minimum requirements for counter heights widths of paths of travel maneuvering clearances ramp slopes etc. The regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation published to implement the requirements of the ADA provides minimum requirements for wheelchair lifts. In the years since the effective date of the Air Carrier Access Act airlines have continued to have built counters too high for use by people with disabilities. Airlines have continued to have built jetways with sections too steep for use by people with disabilities who use wheelchairs and with ramp sections (with slopes exceeding 5 percent for distances greater than 6 feet) lacking handrails. Violations of the ADA can be addressed by private lawsuits in federal court. There is no such right provided by the Air Carrier Access Act. By transferring the requirements for accessibility within the built environment of airports from the ADA to the ACAA this regulations will take from people with disabilities our right to enforce minimum access standards within the built environment. Historically the U.S. Department of Transportation has not been effective in addressing these issues within airport terminals. By not requiring that all flights in a routing that includes a U.S. airport for foreign aircraft flights this regulatory law will not allow people with disabilities to travel internationally on airlines other than U.S. flag carriers. If a routing is purchased with an origination and destination and with at least one stop in a U.S. airport not necessarily the origination or destination location then all flights in that routing should be required to comply with the Air Carrier Access Act. Otherwise using the example in the NPR a person might get to Germany only to be stranded in an airport by an airline refusing to transport a power wheelchair refusing to accept a service animal in the passenger cabin or refusing to provide seating accessible to a passenger with a disability. By only applying the Air Carrier Access Act to routings that have a U.S. origin or destination but not flights that have stops in the U.S. people with disabilities traveling for example to Canada through the U.S. from Europe or South America would have no right to accessible air travel. The concept of exempting foreign carrier flights that are part of a continuous routing but where there is a change of equipment and a change of flight number is simply an invitation to foreign flag airlines to change flight numbers and equipment to avoid the requirements of the Air Carrier Access Act on their routes once outside of the U.S. on flights that begin end or go through the U.S. It is suggested that waiver language specifically exclude any waivers concerning the transportation of service animals in the passenger cabin of aircraft. Some foreign flag airlines have attempted to require that all service animals be crated and transported in baggage. Some foreign flag airlines have attempted to require that all service dogs be muzzled in the passenger cabin of their aircraft. These types of regulations serve to prevent people with disabilities who are partnered with service animals from being able to fly on foreign flag airlines as they either cannot be separated from their service animals or their service dogs are unable to perform their trained tasks when muzzled. The ""direct threat"" language should specifically state that a person with a disability with a service animal cannot be denied air transportation or be denied having the service animal in the passenger cabin due to the animal being a direct threat unless the animal actually exhibits aggressive behavior (growling at or attempting to bite) towards a person in the airport or on the aircraft. No service animal can be deemed to be a direct threat based on the breed or size of the service animal. A service animal cannot be deemed to be a direct threat based on the size of the animal unless the service animal cannot fit into the space in front of the row of seats in which the passenger with a disability is seated with the extra depth of a bulkhead row or in any other seating row on the aircraft without protruding into a main traffic aisle of the aircraft. It is strongly suggested that the Final Rule contain specific language as to the requirements for emotional support animals. These requirements should specifically state that only people who are disabled due to a mental illness (substantially limited in the ability to engage in one or more major life activities due to a mental impairment) and not every person who has been diagnosed with a mental illness can have emotional support animals in aircraft passenger cabins. The medical documentation should specifically state that the person is disabled based on this legal standard and that a simple statement of diagnosis or a statement of disability based on the medical definition of disability is not sufficient. An airline should be required to apply for a waiver to a requirement that medical oxygen be provided on all flights with the waiver only being available when the airline can demonstrate that due to the aircraft design it is not possible to provide medical oxygen consistent with the FAA requirements. The rule should also set a fee structure for providing medical oxygen as a defined multiple of the actual costs to the airline for providing medical oxygen (such as 2 times or 3 times the actual cost to the airline). Leaving this out of a regulatory law until some future date results in this regulatory law not providing equal access to air travel to passengers with disabilities due to breathing impairments. Since the passage of the ADA there has developed a history of regulatory law and case law that prohibits businesses from charging people with disabilities based on the space such people occupy. This proposed rule would result in this being the only regulatory law that allows such additional charges. Stadiums movie theaters and other assembly facilities just as airlines earn income by the sale of seats. While a stadium may provide seats that are 18 or 20 inches wide to the general public the ADAAG requires that a seating space for a person using a wheelchair must be no less than 33 inches wide. No additional charge can be made of a person with a disability due to the additional width of a wheelchair accessible seat. Restaurants earn money based on how many tables and how many customers they can fit into their facilities. The ADAAG requires that accessible tables provide 30 inches of width for people with disabilities who use wheelchairs and that such tables be on an accessible route no less than 36 inches wide. Restaurants are not permitted to charge customers with disabilities for the extra space required to accommodate such customers. Airlines are the only entity not required to provide extra seat width to customers with disabilities who use wheelchairs. It is more than fair that airlines be required to provide a minimum width to passengers with disabilities not all people who are obese but those who are ""substantially limited"" and to only be able to charge an extra fee when the passenger needs a seating width that exceeds this minimum requirement. It is suggested that the standard used in the ADAAG be used in this rule with an additional charge only being allowed when the passenger requires a seating width exceeding 30 inches. The Departments ""long standing"" rule has shown to have the end result of denying equal access to air travel for people with disabilities who are unable to fit into a 16 to 18 inch wide seat and should not be carried forward into the new rule. Until such time as this rule is amended to address new technology for providing information at gates that is accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing the rule should require that airline gate personnel will directly provide information provided in an audible format by public address to any passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing and who request such assistance and who are seated within the gate area when an announcement is made. If the final rule allows two years for existing airline websites to be accessible to people who are blind an excessive delay then the final rule should require that any airline with an inaccessible website that offers lower ticket prices or waives any ticketing fees to internet customers offer those same lower prices or waiver of ticket fees to passengers who purchase tickets by telephone and who self identify as being blind or disabled due to a visual impairment. As to providing a means to request accessibility services through a website this should not apply to requesting bulkhead seating or seating with additional leg room for passengers with disabilities who qualify for such seating. Based on the history of people committing fraud to obtain what they believe to be better seating (in sports facilities and concert facilities in addition to in air travel) such requests should be made by telephone when appropriate questions can be asked of the passenger to verify that the passenger qualifies for such seating. The availability of the regulatory law should require that this material be provided in print (including alternative formats) and not just on the computers of the airline. There is a history of at least one major airline only having 14 CFR Part 382 on their computers not allowing the passenger to go behind the counter to see the computer screen and only printing out very limited parts of the regulatory law thereby not giving the passenger access to this information. Based on this history of abuse by one of the largest U.S. flag airlines a very explicit rule is needed. The time frame for accessibility in foreign airports seems to be reasonable but as stated above the requirements of Titles II and III of the ADA including the ADAAG should apply to all airline leased and/or operated elements of the built environments of airports in the U.S. Electronic ticketing kiosks should be accessible to people with disabilities including those who use wheelchairs and those who are blind. In addition to providing operating controls within reach ranges usable by people using wheelchairs the video displays of these devices should be required to be at a height and at an angle that makes the visible and readable to people who are seated in wheelchairs. Just as ATMs now provide audible information for those people unable to see these kiosks should be equipped to provide equal access to people who are blind or disabled due to visual impairments. Many airlines perform additional security screening at the gates prior to or during boarding. This rule should address a specific issue that of searching wheelchairs. If a wheelchair is to be searched with the person required to transfer from the wheelchair a transfer station with a fixed seat and fixed grab bars meeting the ADAAG requirements for grab bars at water closets (ADAAG section 4.16.4) should be provided with a screen that can be put in place as requested for privacy during the transfer. While recognizing the regulatory authority issue this requirement should also apply to airport security screening areas when a transfer is required. While there is no reason to provide movable armrests on aisle seats of rows where passengers with disabilities may not sit there is no basis for excluding those rows when determining the number of aisle seats that must have movable armrests. Since the rule requires that only 50 percent of aisle seats must have movable armrests the rows that are not available based on FAA rules for passengers with disabilities would be part of the 50 percent of aisle seats without movable armrests. By excluding those seats from the count of seats on which the number of seats accessible to people with disabilities is calculated this will simply reduce for no reason the availability of accessible aisle seats. There is full agreement that there is no foundation for any type of seat being excluded from the requirement for movable armrests. The major airlines have used the failure to require 50 percent of seats including all seat types to engage in intentional discrimination against people with disabilities. The seats that never have movable armrests are those seats where the airline does not want passengers with disabilities. With the exception of one or two airlines no airline has provided movable armrests in business class or first class cabins. With no exceptions no airline has provided movable armrests on bulkhead aisle seats seats in high demand by business travelers and travelers with infants even though 14 CFR Part 382 requires that bulkhead seating be provided to passengers with disabilities with immobilized leg joints and those with service animals. The airlines have simply used the lack of specific language concerning this issue to deny necessary seating to passengers with disabilities so that have these seats available for their business travelers. The failure to require accessible lavatories on aircraft with only one aisle has resulted in many people with disabilities being unable to travel by air. People with bladder and/or bowel issues that are part of their disabling impairments continue to be denied equal access to air travel due to the lack of aircraft with accessible lavatories. The requirement for accessible lavatories should not be based on the number of aisles of an aircraft but on the seating capacity of the aircraft. The Department should determine the number of seats lost to the provision of an accessible lavatory and should then determine at what number of seats the loss of that number of seats would not result in an undue financial burden. This commenter suggests that in aircraft with 200 or more seats that an accessible lavatory should be provided. The dimensions for the space for storing a folding wheelchair in the passenger cabin of aircraft is not sufficient for many folding wheelchairs. The standard clear floor space requirement for a stationary wheelchair is 30 inches wide and 48 inches deep. When a wheelchair is folded the width is reduced but not the length. Therefore the dimensions should be the 13 inch width and the 36 inch height but the length should be increased from 42 inches to 48 inches. Additionally the dimensions should be stated as width length and height so that airlines do not attempt to provide a space that is only 36 inches long but 48 inches high. An alternative of strapping a folding wheelchair into seats and bumping passengers as necessary is not a reasonable alternative to providing an actual storage space for a folding wheelchair. This opinion is based on the history of airlines violating the requirements of the Air Carrier Access Act in the past. If an airline was to refuse to provide this alternate folding wheelchair storage location claiming that the seats are sold the passenger with a disability will be confronted with a choice of not flying on the scheduled flight or risking damage to the wheelchair placed in baggage. Airlines are well known to give people seeking a CRO for assistance the choice of deplaning and missing the flight or accepting the violation of their rights. Anything that replaces a built in means of compliance with a staff provided means of compliance simply invites violations. The intent of the existing regulation concerning passengers with a fused or immobilized leg was never to have that passenger extend his/her leg into the main aisle of the aircraft. The existing rule requires bulkhead seating or other seating with additional leg room. Extending a leg into the main aisle is not effective places the passenger with a disability at risk of injury and impacts on the use of the aisle by the cabin crew and by other passengers. Additionally many people with disabilities have both legs fused or immobilized making it impossible for such people to fly if the only additional leg room is provide by having a leg extended into an aisle. A person unable to bend a leg to fit into the space of a standard seat cannot magically bend that leg during take off and landing when the FAA requires that the main aisle be clear of obstruction. That person cannot magically develop the ability to bend that leg when beverage and food service carts require the full width of the aisle be clear. Extending an already damaged leg into the aisle invites injury as passengers walk into the extended leg. I have been injured in this way and I have had a leg brace damaged by impact with my brace by a beverage cart. The regulation should require that bulkhead seating or other seating with additional leg room be provided for passengers with disabilities with fused or immobilized legs. When an airline chooses through aircraft cabin configuration design to not provide any accessible bulkhead seating with additional leg room or any other seating with additional leg room then the rule should require that the airline provide without additional charge either a business class or first class seat that does have additional leg room or two adjacent coach class seats so that the passenger has the additional needed leg room by sitting at an angle and using the foot space of the two seats. An airline can be relieved of this financial burden simply by providing accessible bulkhead seating that has extra leg room. The existing regulation with the addition of specifying which side of the aircraft aisle the person is seated DOES NOT resolve the problem faced by people with fused or immobilized legs. There is no question that the existing rule that allows airlines to refuse to place passengers with disabilities in business class or in first class when the passenger cannot be accommodated in coach class has resulted in extensive discrimination against passengers with disabilities. Airlines have chosen to eliminate accessible bulkhead seating by combining bulkhead seating with exit row seating thereby eliminating coach seating with space for people with service animals and seating with space for people with fused or immobilized leg joints. Airlines should be required to provide business class seating or first class seating for passengers with service animals and for passengers with fused or immobilized leg joints on aircraft that do not provide coach seats with extra leg room. The regulation should be specific as to how much extra leg room is required in a row of coach seats to relieve the airline of the requirement to provide business class or first class seating at no additional cost to the passenger with a disability. As stated previously passengers with disabilities who are too large to fit in a standard coach seat should be provided with a wider seat up to 30 inches in width either by providing such passengers with two coach seats or by seating such passengers in business class or first class if such seats provide a sufficient width. Safeguards for abuse are not a significant issue. The passenger with fused or immobilized leg joint(s) should be required to either demonstrate that the immobilization exists or provide medical documentation of such immobilization. As for those with service animals and those too large to fit in a single coach class seat the issue requiring business class or first class seating is obvious. Since the business class or first class seating requirement is linked to the airlineе_s decision to not provide seating in coach class that is usable by such people these passengers should not be excessively burdened with documentation requirements. Arriving passengers with disabilities seeking assistance at the ticket counter should not be required to request such assistance in advance. Only if passengers with disabilities are seeking assistance prior to reaching the ticket counter such as for transporting baggage from the parking garage or at curb side baggage checking locations should it be appropriate for airlines to seek advance notice of no more than 24 hours. In order for people with disabilities to be able to make connecting flights we cannot be excessively delayed in deplaning. Airlines typically refuse to deplane passengers needing to use an aisle chair until all other passengers have deplaned. This practice should be unlawful. The regulation should require that passengers with disabilities be deplaned at the same time as passengers seated in the rows adjacent to that passenger are able to deplane. Therefore a passenger with a disability seated near the rear of the aircraft with the exits at the front of the aircraft would be deplaned when most other passengers had already deplaned but a passenger with a disability seated near the front of the aircraft with front of aircraft exits would be deplaned prior to those seated further back in the aircraft. Many passengers flying with limited connecting time choose seats that facilitate prompt deplaning. This same ability should be available to passengers with disabilities including those who require the assistance of an aisle chair when boarding and deplaning. Concerning the stowage of power wheelchairs in the baggage compartment regulatory language is needed that prohibits the disassembly of power wheelchairs where the batteries are clearly marked as non-spillable (meeting FAA requirements) and where the connection between the batteries and the motors can be disconnected by a key switch or by unplugging a power cord. Several airlines most notably American Airlines frequently disassemble power wheelchairs claiming that the batteries have to be disconnected at the battery terminals regardless of other means of isolating the battery power from the motors of the wheelchair. When a wheelchair is disassembled the regulation should clearly state that the airline is responsible for reassembling the wheelchair. The regulation should suggest or require that the airline employee who disassembles the wheelchair provide written information as to how the wheelchair was disassembled to aide the airline employee at the arrival location in the reassembly of the wheelchair. Baggage liability should include a requirement that when a mobility device is damaged by an airline an equivalent mobility device must be provided within one hour of arrival and the recognition that the mobility device has been damaged. Providing a 45 pound manual wheelchair to a person who can only push an ultra light wheelchair or to a person in a power assist manual wheelchair or a power wheelchair does not restore the mobility to that person that has been taken away by the damage done to the personе_s mobility device. The regulation should provide the airlines with a choice of having on hand a variety of types of wheelchairs for temporary replacement of damaged wheelchairs or have a contracts with a local wheelchair companies that provides for a variety of temporary replacement wheelchairs to be available during all hours of airline operations at each airport from which the airline operates. There is no question that the current training of airline personnel and contract employees is inadequate. At this time only passengers with disabilities who are knowledgeable as to their rights under the Air Carrier Access Act have any chance at all of not having their rights violated. Ticketing agents on the telephone rarely know of the rules for accessible seating and often refuse to provide seat reservations currently required by the regulations. Agents at ticket counters are typically not educated in these areas either. Gate agents typically do not know the regulatory requirements and often do not even know who the CRO is for their airline. Training of all airline employees who have contact with the public specific to the issues that each employee addresses should be required in detail in these regulations. For example reservation staff should be trained as to the seating requirements. Ticket counter staff should be trained as to seating requirements and airport assistance requirements. Requiring overall and generalized training of the ACAA requirements of all employees simply results in employees not receiving sufficient detailed training of the ACAA issues relevant to their customer interactions. As far as complaints made to CROs the regulations should require that the passenger whose complaint has not been resolved be provided with written documentation of the complaint at the time the complaint is made unless the request for the CRO was made by the passenger less than 15 minutes prior to the scheduled departure of the aircraft on which the passenger is traveling. Airlines especially American Airlines have typically refused to provide any on the scene documentation and then when documentation of the complaint is mailed to the passenger some days or weeks later the information is incorrect and tends to minimize the discriminatory actions of the airline. Only by providing documentation at the time of a violation of the rights of a passenger with a disability can there be any hope of truthfulness on the part of the airlines. The language addressing emotional support animals for people with disabilities due to mental illness should be improved to include that the documentation from the mental health professional specifically identify the major life activity from which the person is substantially limited. The vast majority of people who suffer mental illness do not meet the ACAA/ADA definition of disability which requires a substantial limitation of the ability to engage in one or more major life activities. (It should be noted that no court has determined that the ability to travel by air is a major life activity.) Fundamental to the determination of disability is that such determination is not based on diagnosis but on the impact of an impairment. A doctorе_s letter that provides a diagnosis does not establish that the person is disabled under the standards of this law. The regulatory language should also include a provision that seating with additional floor space for a service animal shall be provide on a priority basis to people with disabilities with service animals and only provided to people with emotional support animals when there is no need for such seating by a person with a service animal. It should be noted that service animal users specifically service dog users have great concerns about large numbers of people with poorly trained emotional support animals being allowed on aircraft. Many of these dogs prove to be dog aggressive while service dogs are typically trained to never show aggression. A confrontation between a dog aggressive emotional support dog and a non-aggressive service dog can result in permanent harm to the service dog who might then be unable to work effectively around other dogs. Additionally with airlines designing cabins with very little space for service animals a broad inclusion of people with mental illnesses who are not disabled but who wish to travel with their emotional support dogs creates an uncomfortable competition for the limited available space. If it is the desire of DOT to broadly define the class of people with emotional support dogs who can bring their dogs into the passenger cabins of aircraft then DOT should also require additional seats in aircraft that have the floor space for such dogs without creating a competition through scarcity. AS TO SERVICE ANIMALS AND SEATING: The regulatory language concerning service animals specifically the language concerning service animals fitting under a seat is wholly inadequate and will result as has been the case since this language was published in a DOT guidance in people with disabilities with service animals being denied transportation by airlines. Nowhere in the existing regulation is there a requirement that service animals fit under the seat in front of a passenger with a disability. In fact the existing regulations require that bulkhead seating be provided to passengers with disabilities with service animals. The Department clearly recognized at that time that most service animals could never fit under a seat in an airplane (at a time when seats were significantly wider than is now the case). Guide dogs for people who are blind are typically dogs weighing from 60 to 100 pounds a size necessary for them to perform the tasks needed by people who are blind. Mobility assistance dogs are typically as large or larger than guide dogs as they must be able to perform tasks such as pulling people in wheelchairs bracing people for transferring and providing balance assistance to people with mobility impairments who are ambulatory. It is impossible for most 75 pound or larger guide dog or most 90 to 120 pound mobility assistance dog that pulls a person in a wheelchair to fit in the 16 or 17 inch wide space under a seat in an airplane. The problem of space for service animals has increased dramatically due to decisions by airlines that have reduced the accessibility of their aircraft in violation of the requirements of the ACAA. Each time an aircraft with an accessible coach bulkhead row (a bulkhead row that is not an exit row) has been replaced with an aircraft having no coach bulkhead row or with all coach bulkhead rows being exit rows the airline has reduced the accessibility of their fleet. Such changes should be prohibited unless other regulatory language requires usable and effective alternatives to providing accessible bulkhead rows. When an accessible bulkhead row in a row of three seats has 10 inches of additional foot and leg space than at other rows then this space can be occupied by a service animal without taking from other passengers the foot and leg space that would be available in other rows of seats. Using the all too typical 16 inch wide seat this would provide a space 48 inches long by 10 inches wide for the service animal (actually more space than that is provided as a width of 16 inches for a seat does not include the width of the armrests). With the service animal also being able to occupy some of the foot and leg space of the person traveling with the service animal most service animals can be accommodated. Since the existing regulatory law required that bulkhead seating be provided any change in the regulatory law that does not require the amount of floor space detailed above (10 inches by 36 inches in rows with 2 seats 10 inches by 48 inches in rows with 3 seats) represents a reduction of accessibility and is unacceptable. In order to comply with the Congressional mandate this regulatory law must insure that people with disabilities with service animals do have equal access to commercial air travel. This regulatory change does not provide this access. What should be required is that airlines either provide accessible coach bulkhead seating with additional leg and foot space that can accommodate service animals or if the airline chooses to not provide accessible coach bulkhead seating the airline must provide an empty seat next to the passenger with the service animal or must seat the passenger with the service animal in a business class or first class seat that provides the necessary floor space. Only when a service animal cannot fit in the space that should be provided in an accessible bulkhead row (10 inches by 48 inches plus the foot space of the person traveling with the service animal) should the airline be allowed to require the service animal to travel in cargo or baggage because of the size of the service animal. It is unacceptable to allow airlines to eliminate seating areas that were designated for priority use by people with disabilities with service animals (and people with disabilities with fused or immobilized legs) and to then make the airlinesе_ decisions the burden of people with disabilities. Airlines have every right",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to design their aircraft interiors as they wish within the limitations of FAA requirements. However they do not have the right to create and build interior designs that ignore the rights of passengers with disabilities. Congress mandated that people with disabilities have equal access to air travel and the DOT has been charged with making this Congressional desire a reality. In order to meet the requirements of the ACAA this regulatory law must insist that airlines provide the space needed by passengers with disabilities who wish to travel by air. If the FAA approves and the public accepts seats that are 16 inches wide then airlines can use these very narrow seats. But they should not then be allowed to force people who due to disability require more space to pay for a larger seat in business class or first class or to purchase two seats. With the approval of the FAA airlines have the right to eliminate bulkhead rows and to combine bulkhead rows with exit rows. It is my opinion that by allowing these changes in the face of the ACAA requirements for bulkhead seating for specific subgroups of people with disabilities that the DOT has allowed airlines to violate the ACAA. This design flexibility should not be allowed to be used to remove from aircraft the floor space needed by travelers with disabilities with service animals and travelers with disabilities with legs that do not bend. The narrower seats have the purpose of increasing airline revenue by allowing more seats to fit into an aircraft. The elimination of accessible bulkhead rows allows airlines to increase the number of seats that can be sold again the purpose is to increase airline revenue. It is not unreasonable for airlines to have to assume some costs associated with these revenue enhancing changes. Whether the cost imposed on the airlines is providing an extra seat without charge to a person with a disability with a service animal (or a person with a disability too large to fit in a too narrow seat) or upgrading that person to business class or first class where the seats are wider and where more leg and foot space is provided that should simply be part of the cost of doing business in the face of revenue enhancing aircraft interior design changes. It is shocking that the DOT mandated by Congress to regulate the airline industry in a manner that provides equal access to air travel for people with disabilities seems more interested in protecting the revenue stream of the airlines at the expense of equal access. The NPRM if it was to become a final rule will prevent many people with disabilities who are unable to afford two coach seats or a business class or first class seat any access to air travel. People with disabilities with legs that cannot bend will be forced to purchase more expensive seats or two coach seats or they simply will not be able to fly. People with disabilities with service animals will be forced to purchase seats in more expensive classes or to purchase two seats. Those with disabilities who cannot afford to pay more than is required of any other passengers will simply be denied air travel. Of the more than 2000 people with disabilities with service dogs I know of no person who would place their service dog at risk by having their service dog flown in a baggage or cargo compartment. As I have stated above the changes in aircraft cabin design that have eliminated accessible seating for people with disabilities with service animals and people with disabilities with legs that do not bend are changes made to enhance airline revenue. The only reasonable response to those changes is for this regulatory law to impose on the airlines the cost of accommodating people with disabilities who have faced this reduction in accessibility. The only alternative to imposing these costs on the airlines rather than making this a burden placed on people with disabilities is for the regulations to require accessible bulkhead seating in all classes of service with specific dimensions for the extra leg and foot space provided at these required bulkhead seating rows. The regulations should require a minimum of seven feet of aisle length to be a minimun of 32 inches in width from the bulkhead to  provide access to aisle seating with flip back arm rests.  This will allow persons using wheelchairs to approach the seating without having to transfer to an aisle chair.  Transferring to aisle chairs is extremely hazardous for many people who use wheelchairs.  As well most people who use wheelchairs cannot transfer independently to the aisle chair and must be lifted by airport or airline personnel causing possible injury to the personnel.

Room PL-401Washington DC 20590.Docket Number OST-2004-19482-1Dear Docket ClerkThe vast majority of comments received by the DOT in response to its Notice of Proposed Rule Making have focused on air travel with service or assistance dogs the most common type of service animal used by disabled or handicapped Americans. The center of attention has been the issue of said dogs being unable to fit in the floor space in front of passengers with disabilities.Current airline practices of providing an empty seat where space is available or asking a volunteer to share leg space with the dog have fostered wonderful working relationships between disabled passengers and the airlines.However the language recommended in the NPRM that suggests that a disabled passenger could be charged for an extra seat asked to take a later flight or have their assistance/service dog shipped in the cargo hold are perceived as threats by members of the assistance dog partner community (thus by the handicapped & disabled community) to their ability to travel by air. The three options cited in the NPRM would have a devastating impact on air travel by assistance/service dog partners for the following reasons: 1. Purchasing a second seat is not a viable option since the additional costs would exclude most disabled people (including myself) with large dogs from traveling by air. It would place an undue financial burden on us and would be seen as discrimination. The frequently cited statistic that 70% of the 54 million Americans with disabilities are unemployed and more than 40% rely on the federal welfare program shows that disabled/handicapped Americans are the most economically deprived of our population. And a second seat certainly wouldn't solve the problem if the flight is booked.2. Taking a later flight doesn't guarantee resolvement of this issue since we may encounter yet another booked flight with no room for our assistance/service dog partners.3. It is completely unacceptable to ship my assistance dog in a cargo hold.  In addition to being a hardship on both myself and my partner any such separation has already been declared a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Crowder v. State of Hawaii. The suggestion of this option by the DOT is an outrage to those of us who depend on our assistance dogs in order to have any semblance of a ""normal"" life and for many of us to even leave our homes at all.Please listen to the IAADP's recommendation that the following be adopted as official advice to in-flight crews and counter agents:""You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin. If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room. If no volunteer is forthcoming and seats are available in another class of service in another part of the cabin you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service.""This approach to the issue of an assistance dog being unable to fit in the floor space in front of a disabled passenger's seat would not be a financial burden for the airlines nor would it be an inconvenience to other passengers. Instead it would formalize current air carrier policies giving those of us with disabilities and handicaps the reasonable accommodation to which we are entitled. If a second seat charge is instituted the airlines would lose revenue due to fewer disabled/handicapped people being able to travel by air. It is my experience and has been proven time and time again that there is normally at least one other passenger willing to share floor space with a service dog when a flight is fully booked. This kindness by others who love animals and care about the disabled/handicapped community is evidenced in my daily life with my service dog partner.The DOT and air carriers might do better to focus on the issue of access in the Air Carrier Access Act. The proposed DOT rules noted in this letter would prohibit such access.Respectfully submittedKatherine I.

I have taken my service animal on many flights to spend time with my family in Kansas. My dog has been welcomed by the airlines with open arms and was given wings. Despite his large size he was able to curl up by my feet we were even given the option of sitting in the bulk head seats. Current airline practices of providing an empty seat where space is available or asking for a volunteer to share leg space with the assistance dog have created excellent working relationships between disabled passengers and the airline industry. However the language recommended in the NPRM suggesting that the disabled passenger could be charged for an extra seat asked to take a later flight or have the assistance dog shipped in cargo are seen as threats by members of the assistance dog partner community to their ability to travel by air. The three options cited in the NPRM would have a devastating impact on air travel by assistance dog partners because: 1. Purchasing a second seat is not a viable option since the additional costs would exclude me from traveling by air. It would place an undue financial burden on me and would be seen as an overt form of discrimination. After becoming disabled I was forced to rely solely on my Social Security Disability checks for my three children and myself.  Finally if a flight is fully booked how would being charged for a second seat solve the problem? 2. Traveling on a later flight does not guarantee the issue will be resolved since the same circumstances may exist on the later flight. 3. As an IAADP member I agree with the stance that shipping the assistance dog in cargo is a totally unacceptable option. This again would make it unable for me to use air transportation due to the fact that my dog must be available to assist me during flight. A number of comments already submitted have indicated such separation was declared a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Crowder case against the state of Hawaii. That this option is even suggested by DOT is an indication of a lack of understanding of the work performed by guide hearing and service dogs and the relationship of these canine assistants to their disabled partners. Once again IAADP recommends the following language be adopted as official advice to in-flight crews and counter agents: ""You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin. If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room. If no volunteer is forthcoming and seats are available in another class of service in another part of the cabin you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service."" Using this approach to the issue of the assistance dog unable to fit within the floor space in front of the disabled passenger's seat would not be a financial burden for the airlines or an inconvenience to other passengers. It would formalize current air carrier policies and be a reasonable accommodation. If the second seat charge is instituted as stated in the NPRM it would lead to a further loss of airline revenue since fewer people with disabilities would be able to travel by air. Where every seat on a flight is occupied at least one other passenger would be willing to share floor space with a guide hearing or service dog. That has been my experience and theexperience of many other IAADP members. DOT and the air carriers should be focusing on the issue of access in the Air Carrier Access Act. The proposed DOT rules noted in this letter would work against such access.

My dog is with me 24 hours a day seven days a week and serves as my ears.  My service dog is the one way I am able to live and function independently and safely. I do NOT approve of the new language in the DOT's Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) .The Department of Transportation's Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) contains an alarming change to the regulatory language about seating accommodations for assistance dog partners. The proposed rule grants airlines the right to require a passenger with an assistance dog to purchase a second ticket if the canine assistant is not small enough to fit in the floor space directly in front of the passenger's seat. Alternatively airlines may require the passenger to ship the dog in cargo or wait for a later flight. I do not believe this proposed policy is ""a reasonable accommodation"" for those of us traveling with assistance dogs. It penalizes disabled people working with large dogs for physical support guidance or wheelchair pulling. Even smaller dogs wearing backpacks containing medical supplies and equipment required by the disabled passenger may not fit into this space.I believe this inclusion of new regulatory language would violate the spirit of the Air Carrier Access Act which Congress passed to ensure the airlines would increase the accessibility of air travel to the disabled population.1.Purchasing a second seat is not a viable option since the additional costs would exclude most disabled people with large dogs from traveling by air. It would place an undue financial burden on them.

Disabled Americans constitute the most economically deprived segment of the population. 2.Traveling on a later flight does not guarantee the issue will be resolved since the same circumstances may exist on the later flight. The prospect of being forced to delay the trip missing connections pick up times and appointments would be a huge disincentive to air travel. 3.Shipping the assistance dog in cargo due to the risk of trauma or loss is an unacceptable option.

I believe the DOT's NPRM language would foster an adversarial relationship between disabled passengers with large assistance dogs and the airlines.Airplane seat sizes have been getting smaller and smaller with less and less leg room over the years.  The goal еР economy еР more people per plane.  Further cramping has then resulted from the average human increasing in size ( height/weight) as well over the years.  But I  believe air carriers must be made to modify their facilities to assure nondiscrimination. The airplane is their facility. The air carrier must modify its facility the aircraft to accommodate assistance dogs of all sizes at least in a few seats or specified areas.  My hearing dog is a physical necessity that must she be with me at all times.  Also By suggesting that airlines may charge for an additional seat if the service animal intrudes into the neighboring passenger's space DOT is violating basic principles of non-discrimination. In addition 382.67 permits carriers to comply with the wheelchair storage requirement by using a strap kit across two or three seats to store the wheelchair and if other passengers are bumped they receive compensation equivalent to denied boarding. No mention in this rule is made of additional charges for the extra seats provided for wheelchair stowage. Providing such an accommodation to the stowage of wheelchairs but not to the placement of service animals can be viewed as discrimination toward one class of disabled passengers. 382.11 Section 3 states: that whatever services are offered to one passenger must also be offered to disabled passengers. If wheelchair users are offered additional seats for the stowage of their wheelchairs then an equivalent accommodation should be made for assistance dog partners. Providing additional space for mechanical assistive devices and denying additional space for live assistive devices namely assistance dogs is discriminatory.Please try to put yourself in my position.  My service animal aids me in my major life activities.  She acts as alert mechanism and an extension of myself just as a cane crutch wheelchair etc. would for another individual.

The proposed rule grants airlines the right to require a passenger with an assistance dog to purchase a second ticket if the canine assistant is not small enough to fit in the floor space directly in front of the passenger's seat. Alternatively airlines may require the passenger to ship the dog in cargo or wait for a later flight. This language violates the spirit of the Air Carrier Access Act.Purchasing a second seat is not a viable option.  The cost is prohibitive. If a flight is fully booked how would being charged for a second seat solve the problem? Traveling on a later flight does not guarantee the issue will be resolved since the same circumstances may exist on the later flight. Shipping  my service dog cargo is NOT an option!This type of  separation was declared to be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Crowder case against the state of Hawaii.

If no volunteer is forthcoming and seats are available in another class of service in another part of the cabin you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service."" Using this approach to the issue of the assistance dog unable to fit within the floor space in front of the disabled passenger's seat would not be a financial burden for the airlines or an inconvenience to other passengers. It would formalize current air carrier policies and be a reasonable accommodation. If the second seat charge is instituted as stated in the NPRM it would lead to a further loss of airline revenue since fewer people with disabilities would be able to travel by air. Where every seat on a flight is occupied at least one other passenger would be willing to share floor space with a guide hearing or service dog. That has been my experience and theexperience of many other IAADP members. DOT and the air carriers should be focusing on the issue of access in the Air Carrier Access Act. The proposed DOT rules noted in this letter would work against such access.

In particular the issue of assistance dogs unable to fit in the floor space in front of passengers with disabilities has been the center of attention. Current airline practices of providing an empty seat where space is available or asking for a volunteer to share leg space with the assistance dog have created excellent working relationships between disabled passengers and the airline industry. However the language recommended in the NPRM suggesting that the disabled passenger could be charged for an extra seat asked to take a later flight or have the assistance dog shipped in cargo are seen as threats by members of the assistance dog partner community to their ability to travel by air. The three options cited in the NPRM would have a devastating impact on air travel by assistance dog partners because: 1. Purchasing a second seat is not a viable option since the additional costs would exclude most disabled people with large dogs from traveling by air. It would place an undue financial burden on them and would be seen as an overt form of discrimination. A frequently cited statistic is that 70% of the 54 million Americans with disabilities are unemployed and more than 40% rely on the federal welfare program.

Please DO NOT include shipping the dog as ""cargo"" as an option for the air carrier.  Service dogs are not equipment like a wheelchair or hearing aid.  Service dogs are trained to assist their human companion in many different situations; and in case of an emergency requiring evacuation of the plane the service animal would be left in the cargo hold (perhaps to burn or to sink) while his/her human companion would be trying to evacuate without the assistance of the service dog.   Please DO NOT suggest that airlines charge a full extra seat for large service dogs because many disabled persons are on low or fixed income and charging an extra fee would mean that they would not be able to travel by air as frequently (or perhaps not at all). thank you for providing the opportunity for comment.

It would place an undue financial burden on them and would be seen as an overt form of discrimination. A frequently cited statistic is that 70% of the 54 million Americans with disabilities are unemployed and more than 40% rely on the federal welfare program. Disabled Americans constitute the most economically deprived segment of our nation's population. Finally if a flight is fully booked how would being charged for a second seat solve the problem? 2. Traveling on a later flight does not guarantee the issue will be resolved since the same circumstances may exist on the later flight. 3. Shipping the assistance dog in cargo is a totally unacceptable option for IAADP assistance dog partner members. A number of comments already submitted have indicated such separation was declared a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Crowder case against the state of Hawaii. That this option is even suggested by DOT is an indication of a lack of understanding of the work performed by guide hearing and service dogs and the relationship of these canine assistants to their disabled partners. Once again IAADP recommends the following language be adopted as official advice to in-flight crews and counter agents: ""You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin. If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room. If no volunteer is forthcoming and seats are available in another class of service in another part of the cabin you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service."" Using this approach to the issue of the assistance dog unable to fit within the floor space in front of the disabled passenger's seat would not be a financial burden for the airlines or an inconvenience to other passengers. It would formalize current air carrier policies and be a reasonable accommodation. If the second seat charge is instituted as stated in the NPRM it would lead to a further loss of airline revenue since fewer people with disabilities would be able to travel by air. Where every seat on a flight is occupied at least one other passenger would be willing to share floor space with a guide hearing or service dog. That has been my experience and the experience of many other IAADP members. DOT and the air carriers should be focusing on the issue of access in the Air Carrier Access Act. The proposed DOT rules noted in this letter would work against such access.

65,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-02-23T23:59:59-05:00,NA,"RE: Air Carrier Access Act.The term ""facility"" should apply only to the aircraft itself and not to any parts of the airport terminals or boarding areas including ticket counters customer service counters check in gate counters jetways or other boarding devices. The ADA Accessibility Guidelines provides minimum requirements for counter heights widths of paths of travel maneuvering clearances ramp slopes etc. The regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation published to implement the requirements of the ADA provides minimum requirements for wheelchair lifts. In the years since the effective date of the Air Carrier Access Act airlines have continued to have built counters too high for use by people with disabilities. Airlines have continued to have built jetways with sections too steep for use by people with disabilities who use wheelchairs and with ramp sections (with slopes exceeding 5 percent for distances greater than 6 feet) lacking handrails. Violations of the ADA can be addressed by private lawsuits in federal court. There is no such right provided by the Air Carrier Access Act. By transferring the requirements for accessibility within the built environment of airports from the ADA to the ACAA this regulations will take from people with disabilities our right to enforce minimum access standards within the built environment. Historically the U.S. Department of Transportation has not been effective in addressing these issues within airport terminals.By not requiring that all flights in a routing that includes a U.S. airport for foreign aircraft flights this regulatory law will not allow people with disabilities to travel internationally on airlines other than U.S. flag carriers. If a routing is purchased with an origination and destination and with at least one stop in a U.S. airport not necessarily the origination or destination location then all flights in that routing should be required to comply with the Air Carrier Access Act. Otherwise using the example in the NPR a person might get to Germany only to be stranded in an airport by an airline refusing to transport a power wheelchair refusing to accept a service animal in the passenger cabin or refusing to provide seating accessible to a passenger with a disability. By only applying the Air Carrier Access Act to routings that have a U.S. origin or destination but not flights that have stops in the U.S. people with disabilities traveling for example to Canada through the U.S. from Europe or South America would have no right to accessible air travel. The concept of exempting foreign carrier flights that are part of a continuous routing but where there is a change of equipment and a change of flight number is simply an invitation to foreign flag airlines to change flight numbers and equipment to avoid the requirements of the Air Carrier Access Act on their routes once outside of the U.S. on flights that begin end or go through the U.S.It is suggested that waiver language specifically exclude any waivers concerning the transportation of service animals in the passenger cabin of aircraft. Some foreign flag airlines have attempted to require that all service animals be crated and transported in baggage. Some foreign flag airlines have attempted to require that all service dogs be muzzled in the passenger cabin of their aircraft. These types of regulations serve to prevent people with disabilities who are partnered with service animals from being able to fly on foreign flag airlines as they either cannot be separated from their service animals or their service dogs are unable to perform their trained tasks when muzzled.The ""direct threat"" language should specifically state that a person with a disability with a service animal cannot be denied air transportation or be denied having the service animal in the passenger cabin due to the animal being a direct threat unless the animal actually exhibits aggressive behavior (growling at or attempting to bite) towards a person in the airport or on the aircraft. No service animal can be deemed to be a direct threat based on the breed or size of the service animal. A service animal cannot be deemed to be a direct threat based on the size of the animal unless the service animal cannot fit into the space in front of the row of seats in which the passenger with a disability is seated with the extra depth of a bulkhead row or in any other seating row on the aircraft without protruding into a main traffic aisle of the aircraft.It is strongly suggested that the Final Rule contain specific language as to the requirements for emotional support animals. These requirements should specifically state that only people who are disabled due to a mental illness (substantially limited in the ability to engage in one or more major life activities due to a mental impairment) and not every person who has been diagnosed with a mental illness can have emotional support animals in aircraft passenger cabins. The medical documentation should specifically state that the person is disabled based on this legal standard and that a simple statement of diagnosis or a statement of disability based on the medical definition of disability is not sufficient.An airline should be required to apply for a waiver to a requirement that medical oxygen be provided on all flights with the waiver only being available when the airline can demonstrate that due to the aircraft design it is not possible to provide medical oxygen consistent with the FAA requirements. The rule should also set a fee structure for providing medical oxygen as a defined multiple of the actual costs to the airline for providing medical oxygen (such as 2 times or 3 times the actual cost to the airline). Leaving this out of a regulatory law until some future date results in this regulatory law not providing equal access to air travel to passengers with disabilities due to breathing impairments.Since the passage of the ADA there has developed a history of regulatory law and case law that prohibits businesses from charging people with disabilities based on the space such people occupy. This proposed rule would result in this being the only regulatory law that allows such additional charges. Stadiums movie theaters and other assembly facilities just as airlines earn income by the sale of seats. While a stadium may provide seats that are 18 or 20 inches wide to the general public the ADAAG requires that a seating space for a person using a wheelchair must be no less than 33 inches wide. No additional charge can be made of a person with a disability due to the additional width of a wheelchair accessible seat. Restaurants earn money based on how many tables and how many customers they can fit into their facilities. The ADAAG requires that accessible tables provide 30 inches of width for people with disabilities who use wheelchairs and that such tables be on an accessible route no less than 36 inches wide. Restaurants are not permitted to charge customers with disabilities for the extra space required to accommodate such customers. Airlines are the only entity not required to provide extra seat width to customers with disabilities who use wheelchairs. It is more than fair that airlines be required to provide a minimum width to passengers with disabilities not all people who are obese but those who are ""substantially limited"" and to only be able to charge an extra fee when the passenger needs a seating width that exceeds this minimum requirement. It is suggested that the standard used in the ADAAG be used in this rule with an additional charge only being allowed when the passenger requires a seating width exceeding 30 inches. The Departments ""long standing"" rule has shown to have the end result of denying equal access to air travel for people with disabilities who are unable to fit into a 16 to 18 inch wide seat and should not be carried forward into the new rule.Until such time as this rule is amended to address new technology for providing information at gates that is accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing the rule should require that airline gate personnel will directly provide information provided in an audible format by public address to any passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing and who request such assistance and who are seated within the gate area when an announcement is made.It the final rule allows two years for existing airline websites to be accessible to people who are blind an excessive delay then the final rule should require that any airline with an inaccessible website that offers lower ticket prices or waives any ticketing fees to internet customers offer those same lower prices or waiver of ticket fees to passengers who purchase tickets by telephone and who self identify as being blind or disabled due to a visual impairment.As to providing a means to request accessibility services through a website this should not apply to requesting bulkhead seating or seating with additional leg room for passengers with disabilities who qualify for such seating. Based on the history of people committing fraud to obtain what they believe to be better seating (in sports facilities and concert facilities in addition to in air travel) such requests should be made by telephone when appropriate questions can be asked of the passenger to verify that the passenger qualifies for such seating.The availability of the regulatory law should require that this material be provided in print (including alternative formats) and not just on the computers of the airline. There is a history of at least one major airline only having 14 CFR Part 382 on their computers not allowing the passenger to go behind the counter to see the computer screen and only printing out very limited parts of the regulatory law thereby not giving the passenger access to this information. Based on this history of abuse by one of the largest U.S. flag airlines a very explicit rule is needed.The time frame for accessibility in foreign airports seems to be reasonable but as stated above the requirements of Titles II and III of the ADA including the ADAAG should apply to all airline leased and/or operated elements of the built environments of airports in the U.S.Electronic ticketing kiosks should be accessible to people with disabilities including those who use wheelchairs and those who are blind. In addition to providing operating controls within reach ranges usable by people using wheelchairs the video displays of these devices should be required to be at a height and at an angle that makes the visible and readable to people who are seated in wheelchairs. Just as ATMs now provide audible information for those people unable to see these kiosks should be equipped to provide equal access to people who are blind or disabled due to visual impairments.Many airlines perform additional security screening at the gates prior to or during boarding. This rule should address a specific issue that of searching wheelchairs. If a wheelchair is to be searched with the person required to transfer from the wheelchair a transfer station with a fixed seat and fixed grab bars meeting the ADAAG requirements for grab bars at water closets (ADAAG section 4.16.4) should be provided with a screen that can be put in place as requested for privacy during the transfer. While recognizing the regulatory authority issue this requirement should also apply to airport security screening areas when a transfer is required.While there is no reason to provide movable armrests on aisle seats of rows where passengers with disabilities may not sit there is no basis for excluding those rows when determining the number of aisle seats that must have movable armrests. Since the rule requires that only 50 percent of aisle seats must have movable armrests the rows that are not available based on FAA rules for passengers with disabilities would be part of the 50 percent of aisle seats without movable armrests. By excluding those seats from the count of seats on which the number of seats accessible to people with disabilities is calculated this will simply reduce for no reason the availability of accessible aisle seats.There is full agreement that there is no foundation for any type of seat being excluded from the requirement for movable armrests. The major airlines have used the failure to require 50 percent of seats including all seat types to engage in intentional discrimination against people with disabilities. The seats that never have movable armrests are those seats where the airline does not want passengers with disabilities. With the exception of one or two airlines no airline has provided movable armrests in business class or first class cabins. With no exceptions no airline has provided movable armrests on bulkhead aisle seats seats in high demand by business travelers and travelers with infants even though 14 CFR Part 382 requires that bulkhead seating be provided to passengers with disabilities with immobilized leg joints and those with service animals. The airlines have simply used the lack of specific language concerning this issue to deny necessary seating to passengers with disabilities so that have these seats available for their business travelers.The failure to require accessible lavatories on aircraft with only one aisle has resulted in many people with disabilities being unable to travel by air. People with bladder and/or bowel issues that are part of their disabling impairments continue to be denied equal access to air travel due to the lack of aircraft with accessible lavatories. The requirement for accessible lavatories should not be based on the number of aisles of an aircraft but on the seating capacity of the aircraft. The Department should determine the number of seats lost to the provision of an accessible lavatory and should then determine at what number of seats the loss of that number of seats would not result in an undue financial burden. This commenter suggests that in aircraft with 200 or more seats that an accessible lavatory should be provided.The dimensions for the space for storing a folding wheelchair in the passenger cabin of aircraft is not sufficient for many folding wheelchairs. The standard clear floor space requirement for a stationary wheelchair is 30 inches wide and 48 inches deep. When a wheelchair is folded the width is reduced but not the length. Therefore the dimensions should be the 13 inch width and the 36 inch height but the length should be increased from 42 inches to 48 inches. Additionally the dimensions should be stated as width length and height so that airlines do not attempt to provide a space that is only 36 inches long but 48 inches high. An alternative of strapping a folding wheelchair into seats and bumping passengers as necessary is not a reasonable alternative to providing an actual storage space for a folding wheelchair. This opinion is based on the history of airlines violating the requirements of the Air Carrier Access Act in the past. If an airline was to refuse to provide this alternate folding wheelchair storage location claiming that the seats are sold the passenger with a disability will be confronted with a choice of not flying on the scheduled flight or risking damage to the wheelchair placed in baggage. Airlines are well known to give people seeking a CRO for assistance the choice of deplaning and missing the flight or accepting the violation of their rights. Anything that replaces a built in means of compliance with a staff provided means of compliance simply invites violations.The intent of the existing regulation concerning passengers with a fused or immobilized leg was never to have that passenger extend his/her leg into the main aisle of the aircraft. The existing rule requires bulkhead seating or other seating with additional leg room. Extending a leg into the main aisle is not effective places the passenger with a disability at risk of injury and impacts on the use of the aisle by the cabin crew and by other passengers. Additionally many people with disabilities have both legs fused or immobilized making it impossible for such people to fly if the only additional leg room is provide by having a leg extended into an aisle. A person unable to bend a leg to fit into the space of a standard seat cannot magically bend that leg during take off and landing when the FAA requires that the main aisle be clear of obstruction. That person cannot magically develop the ability to bend that leg when beverage and food service carts require the full width of the aisle be clear. Extending an already damaged leg into the aisle invites injury as passengers walk into the extended leg. I have been injured in this way and I have had a leg brace damaged by impact with my brace by a beverage cart. The regulation should require that bulkhead seating or other seating with additional leg room be provided for passengers with disabilities with fused or immobilized legs. When an airline chooses through aircraft cabin configuration design to not provide any accessible bulkhead seating with additional leg room or any other seating with additional leg room then the rule should require that the airline provide without additional charge either a business class or first class seat that does have additional leg room or two adjacent coach class seats so that the passenger has the additional needed leg room by sitting at an angle and using the foot space of the two seats. An airline can be relieved of this financial burden simply by providing accessible bulkhead seating that has extra leg room. The existing regulation with the addition of specifying which side of the aircraft aisle the person is seated DOES NOT resolve the problem faced by people with fused or immobilized legs.There is no question that the existing rule that allows airlines to refuse to place passengers with disabilities in business class or in first class when the passenger cannot be accommodated in coach class has resulted in extensive discrimination against passengers with disabilities. Airlines have chosen to eliminate accessible bulkhead seating by combining bulkhead seating with exit row seating thereby eliminating coach seating with space for people with service animals and seating with space for people with fused or immobilized leg joints. Airlines should be required to provide business class seating or first class seating for passengers with service animals and for passengers with fused or immobilized leg joints on aircraft that do not provide coach seats with extra leg room. The regulation should be specific as to how much extra leg room is required in a row of coach seats to relieve the airline of the requirement to provide business class or first class seating at no additional cost to the passenger with a disability. As stated previously passengers with disabilities who are too large to fit in a standard coach seat should be provided with a wider seat up to 30 inches in width either by providing such passengers with two coach seats or by seating such passengers in business class or first class if such seats provide a sufficient width. Safeguards for abuse are not a significant issue. The passenger with fused or immobilized leg joint(s) should be required to either demonstrate that the immobilization exists or provide medical documentation of such immobilization. As for those with service animals and those too large to fit in a single coach class seat the issue requiring business class or first class seating is obvious. Since the business class or first class seating requirement is linked to the airlineе_s decision to not provide seating in coach class that is usable by such people these passengers should not be excessively burdened with documentation requirements.Arriving passengers with disabilities seeking assistance at the ticket counter should not be required to request such assistance in advance. Only if passengers with disabilities are seeking assistance prior to reaching the ticket counter such as for transporting baggage from the parking garage or at curb side baggage checking locations should it be appropriate for airlines to seek advance notice of no more than 24 hours.In order for people with disabilities to be able to make connecting flights we cannot be excessively delayed in deplaning. Airlines typically refuse to deplane passengers needing to use an aisle chair until all other passengers have deplaned. This practice should be unlawful. The regulation should require that passengers with disabilities be deplaned at the same time as passengers seated in the rows adjacent to that passenger are able to deplane. Therefore a passenger with a disability seated near the rear of the aircraft with the exits at the front of the aircraft would be deplaned when most other passengers had already deplaned but a passenger with a disability seated near the front of the aircraft with front of aircraft exits would be deplaned prior to those seated further back in the aircraft. Many passengers flying with limited connecting time choose seats that facilitate prompt deplaning. This same ability should be available to passengers with disabilities including those who require the assistance of an aisle chair when boarding and deplaning.Concerning the stowage of power wheelchairs in the baggage compartment regulatory language is needed that prohibits the disassembly of power wheelchairs where the batteries are clearly marked as non-spillable (meeting FAA requirements) and where the connection between the batteries and the motors can be disconnected by a key switch or by unplugging a power cord. Several airlines most notably American Airlines frequently disassemble power wheelchairs claiming that the batteries have to be disconnected at the battery terminals regardless of other means of isolating the battery power from the motors of the wheelchair. When a wheelchair is disassembled the regulation should clearly state that the airline is responsible for reassembling the wheelchair. The regulation should suggest or require that the airline employee who disassembles the wheelchair provide written information as to how the wheelchair was disassembled to aide the airline employee at the arrival location in the reassembly of the wheelchair.Baggage liability should include a requirement that when a mobility device is damaged by an airline an equivalent mobility device must be provided within one hour of arrival and the recognition that the mobility device has been damaged. Providing a 45 pound manual wheelchair to a person who can only push an ultra light wheelchair or to a person in a power assist manual wheelchair or a power wheelchair does not restore the mobility to that person that has been taken away by the damage done to the personе_s mobility device. The regulation should provide the airlines with a choice of having on hand a variety of types of wheelchairs for temporary replacement of damaged wheelchairs or have a contracts with a local wheelchair companies that provides for a variety of temporary replacement wheelchairs to be available during all hours of airline operations at each airport from which the airline operates.There is no question that the current training of airline personnel and contract employees is inadequate. At this time only passengers with disabilities who are knowledgeable as to their rights under the Air Carrier Access Act have any chance at all of not having their rights violated. Ticketing agents on the telephone rarely know of the rules for accessible seating and often refuse to provide seat reservations currently required by the regulations. Agents at ticket counters are typically not educated in these areas either. Gate agents typically do not know the regulatory requirements and often do not even know who the CRO is for their airline. Training of all airline employees who have contact with the public specific to the issues that each employee addresses should be required in detail in these regulations. For example reservation staff should be trained as to the seating requirements. Ticket counter staff should be trained as to seating requirements and airport assistance requirements. Requiring overall and generalized training of the ACAA requirements of all employees simply results in employees not receiving sufficient detailed training of the ACAA issues relevant to their customer interactions.As far as complaints made to CROs the regulations should require that the passenger whose complaint has not been resolved be provided with written documentation of the complaint at the time the complaint is made unless the request for the CRO was made by the passenger less than 15 minutes prior to the scheduled departure of the aircraft on which the passenger is traveling. Airlines especially American Airlines have typically refused to provide any on the scene documentation and then when documentation of the complaint is mailed to the passenger some days or weeks later the information is incorrect and tends to minimize the discriminatory actions of the airline. Only by providing documentation at the time of a violation of the rights of a passenger with a disability can there be any hope of truthfulness on the part of the airlines.The language addressing emotional support animals for people with disabilities due to mental illness should be improved to include that the documentation from the mental health professional specifically identify the major life activity from which the person is substantially limited. The vast majority of people who suffer mental illness do not meet the ACAA/ADA definition of disability which requires a substantial limitation of the ability to engage in one or more major life activities. (It should be noted that no court has determined that the ability to travel by air is a major life activity.) Fundamental to the determination of disability is that such determination is not based on diagnosis but on the impact of an impairment. A doctorе_s letter that provides a diagnosis does not establish that the person is disabled under the standards of this law.The regulatory language should also include a provision that seating with additional floor space for a service animal shall be provide on a priority basis to people with disabilities with service animals and only provided to people with emotional support animals when there is no need for such seating by a person with a service animal. It should be noted that service animal users specifically service dog users have great concerns about large numbers of people with poorly trained emotional support animals being allowed on aircraft. Many of these dogs prove to be dog aggressive while service dogs are typically trained to never show aggression. A confrontation between a dog aggressive emotional support dog and a non-aggressive service dog can result in permanent harm to the service dog who might then be unable to work effectively around other dogs. Additionally with airlines designing cabins with very little space for service animals a broad inclusion of people with mental illnesses who are not disabled but who wish to travel with their emotional support dogs creates an uncomfortable competition for the limited available space. If it is the desire of DOT to broadly define the class of people with emotional support dogs who can bring their dogs into the passenger cabins of aircraft then DOT should also require additional seats in aircraft that have the floor space for such dogs without creating a competition through scarcity.AS TO SERVICE ANIMALS AND SEATING:The regulatory language concerning service animals specifically the language concerning service animals fitting under a seat is wholly inadequate and will result as has been the case since this language was published in a DOT guidance in people with disabilities with service animals being denied transportation by airlines. Nowhere in the existing regulation is there a requirement that service animals fit under the seat in front of a passenger with a disability. In fact the existing regulations require that bulkhead seating be provided to passengers with disabilities with service animals. The Department clearly recognized at that time that most service animals could never fit under a seat in an airplane (at a time when seats were significantly wider than is now the case). Guide dogs for people who are blind are typically dogs weighing from 60 to 100 pounds a size necessary for them to perform the tasks needed by people who are blind. Mobility assistance dogs are typically as large or larger than guide dogs as they must be able to perform tasks such as pulling people in wheelchairs bracing people for transferring and providing balance assistance to people with mobility impairments who are ambulatory. It is impossible for most 75 pound or larger guide dog or most 90 to 120 pound mobility assistance dog that pulls a person in a wheelchair to fit in the 16 or 17 inch wide space under a seat in an airplane.The problem of space for service animals has increased dramatically due to decisions by airlines that have reduced the accessibility of their aircraft in violation of the requirements of the ACAA. Each time an aircraft with an accessible coach bulkhead row (a bulkhead row that is not an exit row) has been replaced with an aircraft having no coach bulkhead row or with all coach bulkhead rows being exit rows the airline has reduced the accessibility of their fleet. Such changes should be prohibited unless other regulatory language requires usable and effective alternatives to providing accessible bulkhead rows. When an accessible bulkhead row in a row of three seats has 10 inches of additional foot and leg space than at other rows then this space can be occupied by a service animal without taking from other passengers the foot and leg space that would be available in other rows of seats. Using the all too typical 16 inch wide seat this would provide a space 48 inches long by 10 inches wide for the service animal (actually more space than that is provided as a width of 16 inches for a seat does not include the width of the armrests). With the service animal also being able to occupy some of the foot and leg space of the person traveling with the service animal most service animals can be accommodated. Since the existing regulatory law required that bulkhead seating be provided any change in the regulatory law that does not require the amount of floor space detailed above (10 inches by 36 inches in rows with 2 seats 10 inches by 48 inches in rows with 3 seats) represents a reduction of accessibility and is unacceptable.In order to comply with the Congressional mandate this regulatory law must insure that people with disabilities with service animals do have equal access to commercial air travel. This regulatory change does not provide this access. What should be required is that airlines either provide accessible coach bulkhead seating with additional leg and foot space that can accommodate service animals or if the airline chooses to not provide accessible coach bulkhead seating the airline must provide an empty seat next to the passenger with the service animal or must seat the passenger with the service animal in a business class or first class seat that provides the necessary floor space. Only when a service animal cannot fit in the space that should be provided in an accessible bulkhead row (10 inches by 48 inches plus the foot space of the person traveling with the service animal) should the airline be allowed to require the service animal to travel in cargo or baggage because of the size of the service animal. It is unacceptable to allow airlines to eliminate seating areas that were designated for priority use by people with disabilities with service animals (and people with disabilities with fused or immobilized legs) and to then make the airlinesе_ decisions the burden of people with disabilities.Airlines have every right to design their aircraft interiors as they wish within the limitations of FAA requirements. However they do not have the right to create and build interior designs that ignore the rights of passengers with disabilities. Congress mandated that people with disabilities have equal access to air travel and the DOT has been charged with making this Congressional desire a reality. In order to meet the requirements of the ACAA this regulatory law must insist that airlines provide the space needed by passengers with disabilities who wish to travel by air. If the FAA approves and the public accepts seats that are 16 inches wide then airlines can use these very narrow seats. But they should not then be allowed to force p",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ople who due to disability require more space to pay for a larger seat in business class or first class or to purchase two seats.With the approval of the FAA airlines have the right to eliminate bulkhead rows and to combine bulkhead rows with exit rows. It is my opinion that by allowing these changes in the face of the ACAA requirements for bulkhead seating for specific subgroups of people with disabilities that the DOT has allowed airlines to violate the ACAA. This design flexibility should not be allowed to be used to remove from aircraft the floor space needed by travelers with disabilities with service animals and travelers with disabilities with legs that do not bend. The narrower seats have the purpose of increasing airline revenue by allowing more seats to fit into an aircraft. The elimination of accessible bulkhead rows allows airlines to increase the number of seats that can be sold again the purpose is to increase airline revenue. It is not unreasonable for airlines to have to assume some costs associated with these revenue enhancing changes. Whether the cost imposed on the airlines is providing an extra seat without charge to a person with a disability with a service animal (or a person with a disability too large to fit in a too narrow seat) or upgrading that person to business class or first class where the seats are wider and where more leg and foot space is provided that should simply be part of the cost of doing business in the face of revenue enhancing aircraft interior design changes.It is shocking that the DOT mandated by Congress to regulate the airline industry in a manner that provides equal access to air travel for people with disabilities seems more interested in protecting the revenue stream of the airlines at the expense of equal access. The NPRM if it was to become a final rule will prevent many people with disabilities who are unable to afford two coach seats or a business class or first class seat any access to air travel. People with disabilities with legs that cannot bend will be forced to purchase more expensive seats or two coach seats or they simply will not be able to fly. People with disabilities with service animals will be forced to purchase seats in more expensive classes or to purchase two seats. Those with disabilities who cannot afford to pay more than is required of any other passengers will simply be denied air travel. Of the more than 2000 people with disabilities with service dogs I know of no person who would place their service dog at risk by having their service dog flown in a baggage or cargo compartment.As I have stated above the changes in aircraft cabin design that have eliminated accessible seating for people with disabilities with service animals and people with disabilities with legs that do not bend are changes made to enhance airline revenue. The only reasonable response to those changes is for this regulatory law to impose on the airlines the cost of accommodating people with disabilities who have faced this reduction in accessibility. The only alternative to imposing these costs on the airlines rather than making this a burden placed on people with disabilities is for the regulations to require accessible bulkhead seating in all classes of service with specific dimensions for the extra leg and foot space provided at these required bulkhead seating rows.""",DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-0521,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,UMInDS,2005-02-23T00:00:00-05:00,Katie Abdou,Katie Abdou,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,

67,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-02-23T23:59:59-05:00,NA,"The proposed rule changes regarding passengers with assistance dogs unable to fit under their seats constitute a blatant form of discrimination against people with disabilities. Assistance dogs are required by law to be allowed into all places of public accomodation with their owners and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that forcing a service dog to be separated from its handler and shipped in the cargo hold of an airplane is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. To force people with assistance dogs to buy an extra seat would also place an undue economic burden on a class of people who already face a rate of unemployment well above the national average. Such an onorous ""fine"" for traveling with an assistance dog would make it prohibitively expensive for many people with disabilities to travel by air at all. These regulations whatever their intention would have the unambiguous effect of placing significant barriers on the ability of people with disabilities to travel freely. I sincerely hope that the Department of Transportation does not want to create second-class citizens through its regulatory enactments because I assure you that this is precisely what you would be doing by adopting these proposed guidelines. I suggest instead that you urge airlines to commission the building of new fleets of planes that will have a larger amount of leg room in some or all of their rows. Such a design modification would be an entirely reasonable accomodation considering that assistance dogs have already been traveling in airplanes for several decades and this change would not only accomodate those with assistance dogs and other mobility aids but also make air travel more pleasant for all passengers perhaps encouraging more people to travel by air and improving the carriers' profit margins. In the meantime ticket counter agents and flight crews should deal with booked flights in which a large assistance dog cannot fit under the passenger's seat by asking for volunteers to take the adjacent seat and if no volunteers come forward by moving the person with the dog or the passenger seated next to them into the first-class cabin. This would not involve any additional expense to the airline since all seats for the flight would have already been sold. I encourage you to consider these common-sense alternatives instead of taking the extremely misguided step of writing discrimination into our transportation regulations.SincerelyKarla Gilbride",DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-0481,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-02-23T00:00:00-05:00,Karla Gilbride,Karla A.

I am one of the top service dog experts in the United States and an ADA Compliance Examiner which means that I travel quite a bit with my Doberman Pinscher service dog. I use a motorized wheelchair and need a large dog to help me transfer to/from seats and/or my wheelchair. Currently I am one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against several airlines who have violated the rights of the disabled with service animals. Out of eight people that travelled to a training seminar with their service dog all 8 had problems related to violations of the ACAA.I find the new reglatory language to restrict rather than open up airtravel to those with assistance dogs. I have flown several times with my Doberman Pinscher and have found that at all times the bulkhead seating was not available either because it was exit row seating or there was no extra leg room in the bulk head seating.If you want to fix this problem without forcing the disabled to pay for an extra seat or have their dog put in cargo (and if this were the case I would not fly at all. And this would impact my job which would not make me happy at all. Here are some suggestions.""You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin. If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room.

The proposed rule grants airlines the right to require a passenger with an assistance dog to purchase a second ticket if the canine assistant is not small enough to fit in the floor space directly in front of the passenger's seat.  Alternatively airlines may require the passenger to ship the dog in cargo or wait for a later flight. Most assistance dogs whether for search and rescue hearing or seeing impaired are large dogs i.e. over 65 lbs.  The breeds often used for these functions are golden retrievers Labradors and German shepherds.  Having flown many times with an 85 lb. German shepherd we can assure you that no assistance dog larger than a miniature poodle can fit between the seats on an airplane.  Therefore the new rule would penalize persons needing the assistance of a canine.Also placing an assistance canine in a cargo hold would further penalize the person needing the dog.  That person may not be able to function without the use of the canine especially when exiting the aircraft.  Further the dog may be traumatized by riding in cold/hot un-pressurized containment or worse yet be lost in transit and therefore be useless to anyone on arrival at their destination.  Please reconsider the wording of the new rule to the one that follows:""You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin.

Purchasing a second seat is not a viable option since the additional costs would exclude most disabled people with large dogs from traveling by air. It would place an undue financial burden on them and would be seen as an overt form of discrimination. A frequently cited statistic is that 70% of the 54 million Americans with disabilities are unemployed and more than 40% rely on the federal welfare program. Disabled Americans constitute the most economically deprived segment of our nation's population. Finally if a flight is fully booked how would being charged for a second seat solve the problem?  2. Traveling on a later flight does not guarantee the issue will be  resolved since the same circumstances may exist on the later flight.  3 Shipping the assistance dog in cargo is a totally unacceptable option for IAADP assistance dog partner members. A number of comments already submitted have indicated such separation was declared a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Crowder case against the state of Hawaii. That this option is even suggested by DOT is an indication of a lack of understanding of the work performed by guide hearing and service dogs and the relationship of these canine assistants to their disabled partners. Once again IAADP recommends the following language be adopted as official advice to in-flight crews and counter agents: ""You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin.

Though I am not a disabled person I work one of a limited number of disaster search dogs in the country and have often travelled in-cabin with my service dog.  I have found the public to be more than accommodating in their response to the needs of my animal which are minimal.  The comfort and confidence that a disabled person is accorded when travelling with their ""eyes"" ""ears"" etc. with them is invaluable . . . to force them to put this integral part of the being into the cargo hold of an aircraft is unconscionable.  Has anyone at the DOT read any of the reports of the accidents that have happened to many of the animals consigned to cargo?  Perhaps the reasoning is that it doesn't happen often but if it happens to your animal once is all it would take to rip confidence from the disabled person travelling.

85,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-03-01T23:59:59-05:00,NA,"Dear Docket Clerk I would like to support the following statement from the International Association of Assistance Dog Partners.The vast majority of comments received by the Department of Transportation (DOT) in response to its Notice of Proposed Rule Making have focused on air travel with assistance dogs the most common type of service animal used by disabled Americans. In particular the issue of assistance dogs unable to fit in the floor space in front of passengers with disabilities has been the center of attention. Current airline practices of providing an empty seat where space is available or asking for a volunteer to share leg space with the assistance dog have created excellent working relationships between disabled passengers and the airline industry. However the language recommended in the NPRM suggesting that the disabled passenger could be charged for an extra seat asked to take a later flight or have the assistance dog shipped in cargo are seen as threats by members of the assistance dog partner community to their ability to travel by air. The three options cited in the NPRM would have a devastating impact on air travel by assistance dog partners because: 1. Purchasing a second seat is not a viable option since the additional costs would exclude most disabled people with large dogs from traveling by air. It would place an undue financial burden on them and would be seen as an overt form of discrimination. A frequently cited statistic is that 70% of the 54 million Americans with disabilities are unemployed and more than 40% rely on the federal welfare program. Disabled Americans constitute the most economically deprived segment of our nation's population. Finally if a flight is fully booked how would being charged for a second seat solve the problem? 2. Traveling on a later flight does not guarantee the issue will be resolved since the same circumstances may exist on the later flight. 3 Shipping the assistance dog in cargo is a totally unacceptable option for IAADP assistance dog partner members. A number of comments already submitted have indicated such separation was declared a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Crowder case against the state of Hawaii . That this option is even suggested by DOT is an indication of a lack of understanding of the work performed by guide hearing and service dogs and the relationship of these canine assistants to their disabled partners. Once again IAADP recommends the following language be adopted as official advice to in-flight crews and counter agents: ""You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin. If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room. If no volunteer is forthcoming and seats are available in another class of service in another part of the cabin you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service."" Using this approach to the issue of the assistance dog unable to fit within the floor space in front of the disabled passenger's seat would not be a financial burden for the airlines or an inconvenience to other passengers. It would formalize current air carrier policies and be a reasonable accommodation. If the second seat charge is instituted as stated in the NPRM it would lead to a further loss of airline revenue since fewer people with disabilities would be able to travel by air. Where every seat on a flight is occupied at least one other passenger would be willing to share floor space with a guide hearing or service dog. That has been my experience and theexperience of many other IAADP members. DOT and the air carriers should be focusing on the issue of access in the Air Carrier Access Act. The proposed DOT rules noted in this letter would work against such access.

86,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-03-01T23:59:59-05:00,NA,"My name is Anne-Elizabeth Straub. I am a Clinical Social Worker an educator and a person with a disability affecting my mobility. I've been partnered with an assistance dog a large Golden Retriever named Meka for the last two years.  I maintain a small private practice and have significant volunteer commitments.  I have occasion to travel by air on business; my own on behalf of non-profits for whom I volunteer and also less frequently for vacations with my family.  In the past two years my assistance dog and I have flown together six times.I am a member of International Association of Assistance Dog Partners as well as a number of other service dog organizations but I am writing primarily as an individual who travels by air.Upon reading the Notice of Proposed Rule Making I am pleased with the extension of the AACA accessibility requirements to foreign air carriers and the requirement for all airline and air travel related companies to make their websites accessible to blind and visually impaired travelers using screen readers.  I am most concerned however about the language which grants the airline the right to charge a disabled passenger for an extra seat put the dog in cargo or make the team get off the plane if the service animal cannot fit in the small space allotted directly in front of the passenger's seat.  I object to this proposal in the strongest manner possible.  I find none of the solutions in the proposed language to be acceptable.  Should the airlines be allowed to charge me for a seat for my service dog I  would not be able to afford to fly.  Like the majority of people with disabilities my income is quite limited and I have significant medical expenses.  It would be more than an inconvenience; it would be a complete bar to travel.  This singles out one class of people with disabilities most of whom have limited financial resources and proposes that they bear a significant and unfair proportion of the costs.  It is not an ""accommodation"" at all.  Up until now Meka has been able to get under the space in front of my seat but it is a very tight fit.  The fit also varies as it does for the human passengers depending on the planes' configurations which change regularly (usually getting smaller not larger)..  Should the space get tighter or should my next dog be larger I might find myself faced unacceptable alternatives.  Bulkhead seating used to be available for this purpose but now the bulkhead seating is mostly at exit locations and not available to us or to people with legs that don't bend.  These are decisions that are made by the airlines when they configure their planes they are not laws of nature.  Having made decisions with no regard for accessibility they would like us to pay for a second (inadequate) seat to compensate for their ""planning"".One of the services my dog provides is assistance with support and balance.  It is one of the reasons that I require a larger dog.  Another service he provides is to carry some of the items to which I require access such as ID and medication.  His harness and backpack add to his size.  If I remove them and allow them to be placed in overhead storage I do not have access to them if I need them.  I believe this is discriminatory because it applies only to people with disabilities who use dogs of a particular size.  It also discriminates between people who use mechanical equipment and those who use live assistance devices; assistance dogs since 382.67(of Title 14 of current FAA regulations) allows for stowage of wheelchairs in the cabin by using a strap kit across two or three seats to store the wheelchair and if other passengers are bumped they receive compensation equivalent to denied boarding. No mention in this        rule is made of additional charges for the extra seats provided for wheelchair stowage.  Why should there not be an equivalent  accommodation for assistance dog partners?  Perhaps parallel language could also be adopted for example: ""If other passengers are bumped because of a service animal they receive compensation equivalent to denied boarding."" Putting my assistance dog in cargo is totally unacceptable for several reasons.  In fact this was deemed as a violation of ADA by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in  Crowder vs. the State of Hawaii.If the dog is in cargo he is not available to me for the services I require.  Also the nature of our relationship is one of consistency and trust.  We are together twenty-four hours per day and are mutually dependent upon each other.  To suddenly disrupt such a relationship and place him alone in an unfamiliar environment in uncertain circumstances and expect him to be unaffected by this and still function is not only unrealistic but potentially damaging to my dog's health and to our relationship. The prospect of being removed from a flight and placed ""on a later flight"" because my dog does not fit under the seat in front of me is appalling!  There appear to be no limitations or guidelines about how  this ""other"" flight might be determined nor any acknowledgment that a person partnered with an assistance dog might have a schedule to maintain or  that such a delay might have a negative impact on the individual.  One of the ways that I manage my symptoms is to manage my schedule and my stress levels.  Going to an airport and planning to be on a scheduled flight at this point in history requires that one arrive at the airport anywhere between one and three hours in advance in order to account for possible traffic delays and security demands.  To then find that one cannot travel on one's scheduled flight and to end up on another possibly hours (or more) later would wreak havoc on any attempt to maintain a level of energy much less a business schedule.  I can not imagine requiring any class of individuals to agree to such conditions!In short what the adoption of these proposed changes would mean to me would be the loss of the ability to travel by air which would be tantamount to leaving me unable to do any long distance travel.  This would reduce my ability to participate in activities that the rest of the population takes for granted. I would be unable to participate in my own business and educational activities and in the volunteer activities that require travel.  This would have a significant impact on my quality of life and the contribution I can make to society.I suggest the Department of Transportation remove that section in the NPRM and replace it with language which does not discriminate against me as a member of a class of individuals with disabilities who use large assistance dogs or place me in the position of having to accommodate the carriers rather than having them comply with the ADA by providing reasonable accommodation to me the person with the disability.   I agree with the language proposed by IAADP which I quote below:""You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin. If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room. If no volunteer is forthcoming and seat are available in another class of service you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service."" I would like to be sure that pre-boarding remains an option available to me and my dog.  It allows me to settle him in.  It seems to me that the time between pre-boarding and regular boarding has become shorter and shorter.  At the time of my last two trips I no sooner got to my seat when other passengers were coming up the aisle.Also I would like to see some statement establishing a coherent practice with regard to establishing areas where the partner can take the dog for elimination and urination.  It would be ideal if one could take care of this without having to check back through security. I have had several different experiences in this regard some where it had been well thought through and some where it had not.  Given the amount of time it takes to get to the airport through the security waiting time  and the flight itself there is substantial addition to  travel time. However taking the break should still be the decision of the person with the disability since they know their own and their dogs' requirements.Please make the regulations reflect a real and continuing effort to increase accessibility of air travel to people with disabilities.Sincerely Anne-Elizabeth Straub LCSW CFT",DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-0767,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-03-01T00:00:00-05:00,Anne-Elizabeth Straub,Anne-Elizabeth W Straub  ,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This proposed change will allow airlines the right to require a passenger with an assistance dog to purchase a second ticket if the canine assistant is not small enough to fit in the floor space directly in front of the passenger's seat.  If the passenger elects not to purchase a second ticket he/she then has the option to ship the dog in cargo or wait for a later flight. We are opposed to this proposed regulation because purchasing a second seat places an undue financial burden on the disabled.  Shipping the assistance dog in cargo is unacceptable since this separation was declared a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Crowder case against the state of Hawaii.

89,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-03-02T23:59:59-05:00,NA,"I am writing regarding the proposed regulatory changes to the Air Carrier Access Act.  These changes are very troubling to me both as the Executive Director of an Indpendent Living Center and as a private individual.  As an individual I have flown to all parts of the US on numerous occasions over the past 20+ years.  This has never been an easy experience but the proposed changes will make it even more difficult for people with disabilities.  As a wheelchair user who is unable to stand I am particularly concerned about the proposed elimination of bulkhead seating and the regulations which allow aircraft to not provide accessible restrooms unless they have more than one aisle.Have you ever had to restrict your fluid intake and not eat anything for several hours prior to a flight continuing to not partake during the flight? This is necessary when one can't get to the restroom for several hours - until a layover or change of planes.  On long flights this can be several hours.  This concern is one of the reasons I've never flown overseas!  Anyone who has ever had surgery that allowed them to have ""nothing by mouth"" after meidnight knows how uncomfortable this is!  Furthermore this causes me to become de-hydrated my legs swell and I feel generally miserable by the time I reach my destination - not a good way to start a vacation or business trip!Trying to board a plane when you can't walk is another uncomfortable humiliating and sometimes dangerous experience.  Being lifted and dragged on a ""straightback"" (a skinny little chair with no wheels and a high back which fits down the aisle of the aircraft)is bad enough but at least bulkhead seating is close to the front and allows the chair to be maneuvered so I can transfer to the seat.  This is not possible in other seating meaning that attendants who are often not trained and not very strong have to lift me into the seat.  This is dangerous for me and them!  Bulkhead seating also gives a bit more room so I can get my legs up keeping swelling (from air pressure and lack of fluids) to a minimum.  Eliminating this seating will also make it nearly impossible for s person with a service dog to fly since there is no room for the animal in regualr seating.  As an agency we have had several complaints from individuals using oxygen who had great difficulty flying.  The proposed regulations will make this even more difficult!  A person is not allowed to take their own oxygen onboard the plane (which is understandable for safety reasons) but many airlines also don't provide oxygen in flight.  What is this individual supposed to do?  I recently spoke with a person who had to pay an extra $100 per flight to have oxygen available to them.  The cost for oxygen ($400) was more than the cost of the airline ticket to Florida!I am also concerned that we are taking a huge step backwards by letting airport terminals and gates fall under the requirements of the ACAA rather than the ADA.  People with disabilities have fought for many years for the protections that the ADA provides only to find that it is being ignored in this circumstance!  Jetways are notoriously unsafe with steep ramps (not meeting code) that end abruptly.  Once again many airline staff are not trained to navigate a wheelchiar safely in this environment.  The proposed regulations will also eliminate the person's right to sue when they have a serious problem while flying as they have under the ADA.Thank you for this opportunty to comment on the proposed regulations.  Plese contact me if further information is required.SincerelyMary Ewing",DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-0913,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-03-02T00:00:00-05:00,Mary Ewing,Mary E.

90,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-03-03T23:59:59-05:00,NA,"      I am a 50 year old with severe scoliosis.  Due to the curvature of my spine my chest cavity is smaller than an average person.  Since my lungs do not have enough space to expand my lung capacity is only 25% of what it should be.  Fortunately I am able to function quite well.  I use supplemental oxygen at night but I rarely need it during the day.  I work 40 hours a week at the Cortland County Probation Department in New York State where I have been employed for 23 years.  At the end of 2002 I was appointed the Director of the Probation Department.     As a member of a ten person team from my community involved in establishing a Drug Court I traveled to Charlotte NC in March 2005 for a training.  The training is funded by a federal grant through the Department of Justice.  On the return flight from Charlotte I had a great deal of difficulty breathing.  My heart was racing and I knew my blood oxygen level was going lower and lower as the flight went on.  I was so relieved when the plane started the descent.  It took me over 3 weeks to recover from that episode.  I had flown before but I had never had such a hard time.  I decided at that time that I would make arrangements to have oxygen on any future flight I might need to take.      The next part of the Drug Court training was scheduled in Traverse City MI from August 9 to August 12.  As soon as I received the flight arrangements through the federal grant program I tried to make arrangements for oxygen on the flights.  I estimate that I made over 50 phone calls attempting to arrange for oxygen.  I was not successful.  I have now learned that an airline does not have to allow oxygen if the airline does allow oxygen it doesn't have to allow it on every flight if the airline allows oxygen on a flight it can limit the number of passengers permitted to use it and the airline can decide to not allow oxygen if its supplies are low.  Also I learned that the airline can charge very high fees for oxygen on each flight.      After I realized I could not travel with my team members I located an airline out of another airport that allowed oxygen on a flight I could use.  After the red tape of getting approval from the funding source to make different travel arrangements I contacted the airline to inform the officials that I needed oxygen on that flight.  I was told oxygen would not be available on the flight since the airline's supplies were running low.  The charge for oxygen on each flight was $100 (the total for my trip would be $400 since I had 4 flights for the round-trip).  I figure the size canister I needed for one flight costs me about $5 when I have it delivered to my home.  When I need oxygen delivered I call the supplier located about 30 miles from my home and the oxygen can be delivered the next day.  I suggested to the airline that with the $95 extra being charged for the oxygen perhaps the supplier could be asked to deliver more.  I was told that the airline orders in bulk and extra deliveries were not possible.      The bottom line is that I did not go to the training.  When I reported to my team that I could not make the necessary travel arrangements they were shocked.  Our leader Judge Thomas Meldrim decided to try his hand at getting the travel arranged.  He met the same barriers.  He also contacted US Senator Charles E. Schumer from NY to see if he could assist.  I appreciate Judge Meldrim's efforts but I did not want to become ""a cause.""  I am a regular person trying to work hard participate in community efforts and attend trainings with my colleagues.  One of the most upsetting aspects of this entire saga is that it has made me feel more handicapped than I have ever felt in my life.  I've always been able to accept my limitations but I have never been excluded from a normal activity that I am capable of participating in.  I apologized to the County officials for being unable to carry out my duties.     It is essential that persons needing medical oxygen during air travel have access to it.  More and more people will be needing this assistance as the population ages.  In this age of trying to eliminate discrimination and encourage inclusion the current regulations and the proposed regulations do just the opposite - they create a whole class of outsiders and ""second class"" citizens.      The Air Carrier Access Act must give ACCESS to travel for all citizens.  I urge the policy makers to amend the regulations and allow oxygen on all flights at a reasonable cost.

In fact she is better behaved than most passengers; ie she doesn't drink she doesn't get loud and she certainly doesn't kick the seat in front of her. I live on railroad retirement disability.

Iam a K9 Search Rescue  Recovery Handler.As well as a 9/11 Responder with my K9. And I have had the need to fly with my K9 (at my side) at times. I could not imagine placing my partner into cargo hold. Every year documented cases of animal deaths are splashed across Newspaper Headlines.What ever happed to a comprimising society! It seems when the need for a ""Working DOg"" is called upon i.e: Arson case Bomb Detection Missing Child Oklahoma City and NYC WTC- everyone Loves the dog.But during other times or in the shadows of forgotteness. These types of dogs and other working dog are left in the cold!My K9 may be forgiving however I not so forgiving. If this means I must resort to other modes of Transport with my K9 I will.

This is obsured.  I am not disabled no one in my family is disabled requiring the assistant of a dog but I am very pleased that we have been able to act as caring individuals to those who are in need and have provided for them on the airlines to this point.  My objections follow:Purchasing a second seat is not a viable option since the additional costs would exclude most disabled people with large dogs from traveling by air. It would place an undue financial burden on them. A frequently cited statistic is that 70% of the 54 million Americans with disabilities are unemployed and more than 40% rely on the federal welfare program. Disabled Americans constitute the most economically deprived segment of the population. Finally if a flight is fully booked how would being charged for a second seat solve the problem? Traveling on a later flight does not guarantee the issue will be resolved since the same circumstances may exist on the later flight. The prospect of being forced to delay the trip missing connections pick up times and appointments would be a huge disincentive to air travel. Shipping the assistance dog in cargo due to the risk of trauma or loss is an option unacceptable to IAADP assistance dog partner members. Such a separation was declared to be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Crowder case against the state of Hawaii. You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin. If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room. If no volunteer is forthcoming and seat are available in another class of service you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service.It is never too much to ask to treat a person with a disability with the highest respect and to provide for them an the most acceptable of manner.RegardsSusan Harber228 Hillside AvenueAtlantic Highlands NJ  07716,DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-0967,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-03-03T00:00:00-05:00,Susan Harber,Susan J.

Scheltema Research BiologistConcerning: OST-2004-19482-9 Air Access LawDate: March 3 2005I am writing about the new regulations proposed by the Department of Transportation regarding assistance dogs on airline flights. These new regulations would impact a very close friend of mine with whom I have become friends through our shared interests both professionally and and socially. She is a nationally and internationally well-known person in her field and travels extensively both here and abroad with her assisting dog in her profession. I have nothing but the greatest admiration for her accomplishments despite her great handicap. She walks only with great difficulty with crutches; her assisting dog gives her the help she needs in moving freely from place to place. It would be a burden on my friend if her assisting dog--a black lab with impeccable good manners--was disallowed to accompany his (and my) friend on airplanes for my friend does not have the kind of wealth that would enable her to buy two seats. Nor could her dog understand being put in a caged box in cargo. It would be a trauma for him and I understand that the separation is not allowed under law (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals). My friend has a strict schedule for speaking engagements training sessions and witnessing in court and could not put off her departure for a later flight.In a word without her assisting dog my friend's professional life would be seriously compromised.I trust that the Department of Transportation will heed the difficulties for disabled persons if the proposed regulations are put in force.Request that DOT not impose new regulations on disabled persons traveling with assisting dogs. The burdens would be financial trauma for the dogs and interferance with time schedules.,DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-1012,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Biology Department MS #34,2005-03-03T00:00:00-05:00,Amelie Scheltema,Amelie H.

99,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-03-04T23:59:59-05:00,NA,Hello my name is Brooke Jaqueth and I am a person with mobility impairments and use a wheelchair.  I am writing to you from Missoula Montana.  I have an assistance dog named Red.  Red is a large Golden Retriever.  I have had Red for seven and a half years.  He has totally changed my life.  Without him I would not have the independence to live my daily life and I would have to rely totally on others for help.  When I travel Red helps me on and off the aircraft to the restrooms etc.  This is why I am writing to you about the regulatory language concerning Seating Accommodations in the Plane Cabin for Disabled Persons with Assistance Dogs.  I am against the proposed new language that would require persons who have assistance dogs to either pay for an extra seat or put the dog in the cargo hold.  I think this proposed language would discriminate against people with disabilities strictly on the basis of their income or needs related disability.  I need Red with me at all times for physical support picking up dropped items handling money and moral support during the difficulties of travel. I cannot afford to pay for an extra seat that the proposed new regulations might require as I live on Social Security benefits.  Also he should not be in the cargo hold because I need him to help on and off the plane to the restrooms etc.  I am not sure the cargo hold is a safe place for such a highly trained dog.  The temperature extremes noise and jarring on the dog crate during the flight could cause him harm and probably would mean that he would be tranquilized during the trip. Red depends on me for his life and safety and would become extremely anxious and agitated without me.  As you may know separation of the person with a disability and their service dog was declared to be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Crowder case against the state of Hawaii.This past week Red and I flew Northwest Airlines to Washington D.C.  The airlines were extremely accommodating as were our fellow passengers.  They placed us in the bulkhead seats and we all had plenty of room.  If they have no problems and are willing to accommodate us then why are these new regulations even necessary?  I suggest that you use the language developed by the International Association of Assistance Dog Partners that states еТYou may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin.  If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room.  If no volunteer is forthcoming and seats are available in another class of service you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service.еУThank you very much for your consideration in this matterBrooke and Red Jaqueth,DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-1040,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary US LLP,2005-03-04T00:00:00-05:00,Brooke Jaqueth,Brooke T.

100,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-03-04T23:59:59-05:00,NA,"I realize that these proposed regulations are under the Air Carrier Access Act and not under the Americans with Disabilities Act however the courts today tend to look to and analogize to situations covered under the ADA. Given this I believe the proposal to charge for extra space for an assistance dog who did not ""fit"" would be a direct violation of accessibility standards and would not be allowed. The analogy is this. Under the ADA ""facilities"" have been required to meet certain accessibility standards. For example a movie theater not only has to provide for access into the theater but within the theater they must provide room for people in wheel chairs. Most theaters today will have taken out several seats to provide for this. Regarding air travel the airports are owned by governmental or private entities and not by the airlines. So what is an airlineеХs facility? It is of course their planes and there is no reason they should not be held to the same accessibility standards as any other business.Personally I think the regulation which should be proposed is for each airplane to have no less than two rows which meet accessibility standards. By this I mean rows with sufficient ""pitch"" to allow space for assistance dogs for people traveling with medical equipment  for those of us with mobility problems which do not let us bend our legs etc. In addition there is no reason given the level of technology today that at least one seating area in each of these rows could not be designed as a docking station for wheelchairs so that wheelchair passengers would not be required to transfer to airplane ""loading platforms"" and face the possibility of wheelchair storage issues or loss ( see Wheelchair lost by AA!  http://web1.flyertalk.com/forum/showthread.php?t=340518 )The reality is airlines adjust their seating configurations on an ongoing basis sometimes for cost reasons but often for marketing reasons. A simple search in Google will produce a plethora of articles on this subject. - for example: Airline Seat Space  http://www.viamagazine.com/top_stories/articles/airline_seat_space00.asp ; The Quality of Airline Service:Are your legs getting longer? http://www.zsrlaw.com/publications/articles/fjc9909.htm  ;  Airline Seating Variations http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/miles/2003-09-29-askrandy48_x.htm. Under the ADA when a facility is remodeled - which is what a change in seating configuration is - the facility by law must remodel to the new ADA accessibility standards.But wait someone is sure to say - the airlines can not do that because it will cost them revenue. Even if this were true - which it may or may not be - why are they any different from any other business. Going back to the movie theater and the empty space for wheelchairs. It is possible that those seats are not full for every showing. Is the business losing money because they are required to have them? Possibly but not necessarily. The reality is it is irrelevant because our society has made the judgement call under the ADA that the cost involved is a legitimate social cost. Personally I donеХt believe the airlines would lose money because if the accessible seating was not reserved for someone whose condition required the extra space IеХm sure they would have a line of passengers waiting to take advantage of a seat with a bit more room.Regarding the proposal that the team should be separated and the dog shipped as cargo I can only say this shows a stunning lack of knowledge about the use of and necessity for assistance dogs. In addition airlines can refuse to ship dogs in cargo depending on the outside temperatures. How would the situation be handled if that was a problem? Furthermore refer back to the link about the lost wheelchair for which the person had to fight to even get proper recompense for the chair never mind the incredible disruption to that personеХs life. A trained dog cannot just be reordered like a piece of mechanical equipment. Every assistance dog program in this country has a waiting list  sometimes as long as several years.Finally I would like to know the rational for even proposing this regulation regarding charging extra ( another problem - this extra is undefined) for what the airlines choose to call an ""oversized"" assistance dog. Once again I refer you to the web. There are a number of sites devoted to frequent travelers and their problems. A search of them did not produce one complaint about assistance dogs but did produce a flood of complaints about airline seating and the cramped space. For example from Flyer Talk "" Is it just me or do certain airlines (ATA America West) reconfigure seats so that only pygmies could be comfortable? I am only 6-0 and I swear to god that every year there is less & less room on these planes. I'm 38 so I don't think I'm getting taller. Anyone ""in the know"" about this or am I hallucinating? "" posted by KevinSkomsvold at 9:40 PM PST on April 29.My two favorite comments came in response on how to make a long coach ride comfortable. The first one was еФDrink heavily or upgrade or preferably do both"". The second suggestion was this - ""My proposal is to drug everyone before the flight and then just ship them as pressurized freight. Think about it. No airline food no crying babies no rude flight attendants no having to listen to crashing bores that you happen to be seated next to or idiots screaming as your plan spirals down from thirty thousand feet into the Atlantic due to mechanical failure."" I quote these merely to give a flavor to what real travelers are complaining about. They are not complaining about assistance dogs AT ALL. So if the rational behind this regulation is the ""protection"" of other passengers rights  there doesnеХt seem to be a screaming mob demanding this protection. On the other hand there does seem to be a screaming mob who have the same concerns as disabled passengers traveling with assistance dogs and that is how do we STOP the airlines from constantly making the space available to travelers smaller. Perhaps this is the problem DOT should be addressing rather than pandering to the airlines by proposing a new illegal revenue source for them.Elizabeth Shea J.D.  bshea313@yahoo.com ",DOT-OST-2004-19482,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2004-19482-1077,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-03-04T00:00:00-05:00,Elizabeth Shea J.D.,Elizabeth Shea J.D.,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
101,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-03-04T23:59:59-05:00,NA,"Public Comment on ACAA's New proposed regulations.Date: March 3 2005 Docket Number: OST-2004-19482-9I am writing concerning several the proposed rules in the NPRM for 14 CFR Part 382 Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel; Proposed Rule. I am a training and outreach coordinator and I travel extensively both domestically and internationally as part of my position. I am also a person who uses a wheelchair whose independence and ability to contribute to society have been greatly enhanced in the last two years by the addition of a service dog. If a few of the changes being proposed go into effect I will not only be incapable of traveling I will lose my job and be forced back into the social security system. 1.Foreign Carriers operating flights to and from the U.S. or operating beginning or ending in the U.S. should be required to comply with the ACAA as a condition of operating in the U.S. In this manner people with disabilities will have equal access to choice of airlines flights and cost as a non-disabled passenger. If foreign carriers are permitted to operate in accessible services within the U.S. is essentially sanctioned discrimination.2.Service Animal Guidelines Appendix AA. Oversea flight time restrictionsеС Service animals have been flying internationally since their inception when the first dog guide was brought over from Europe routinely making flight to Europe Africa and all other corners of the world. The concern over drinking and elimination functions for these highly skilled dogs is unnecessary. When a person partnered with an assistance animal travels with them there is a lot of effort and thought put into preparing the animal to make such a journey. Some of the preparations routinely taken include changing food and water schedule ensuring the animal has completely emptied themselves before the journey and choosing flight times based on when the animal would normally be sleeping. My own dog has gone upwards of 17hrs without showing the slightest need for elimination through the use of such precautions. This restriction is unnecessary and will only serve to limit people with disabilities further in their life.B. I find several elements of this passage troublesome including the ambiguity of definition s of the phrase direct threat and significant disruption because there are some staff and cultures that would say the present of a dog alone causes both of these condition and should not be allowed at all service animal or not. There are also unfair stereotypes concerning certain breed or sizes of dogs that in the mind of some even in the absence of the behaviors described pose a direct threat or significant disruption in themselves (1) pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others (e.g. animal displays threatening behaviors by growling snarling lunging at or attempting to bite other persons on the aircraft) or (2) cause a significant disruption in cabin service (i.e. a ``fundamental alteration'' to passenger service). Inconvenience of other passengers is not sufficient grounds to deny a service animal carriage in the cabin; as indicated later in this document however airlines are not required to ask other passengers to relinquish space that they would normally use in order to accommodate a service animal (e.g. space under the seat in front of the non-disabled passenger).C.Service animal fitting in the space assigned. The passage quoted herein doesnеХt all for some of the basics services allowed to all other passengers including the ability to be upgraded if the booked seat is unavailable and that is discriminatory in practice. It is not the disabled personеХs fault that many bulkhead rows which are routinely offered to service dog partners have now become exit rows where disabled people are not permitted to sit or that the foot space in front of seat is continually shrinking with the sized of the seats. This paragraph doesnеХt allow for the possibility of the simple solution that on any given flight they may be a person who not only doesnеХt mind sharing foot space with a dog but also would love to do just that. A If the service animal does not fit in the assigned location you should relocate the passenger and the service animal to some other place in the cabin in the same class of service where the animal will fit under the seat in front of the passenger and not create an obstruction such as the bulkhead. If no single seat in the cabin will accommodate the animal and passenger without causing an obstruction you may offer the option of purchasing a second seat traveling on a later flight or having the service animal travel in the cargo hold. As indicated above airlines may not charge passengers with disabilities for services required by part 382 including transporting their oversized service animals in the cargo compartment.I have been flying with my service dog for two years and have always found someone more than happy to sit next to the dog. I would like to see the above language replace with the more fair policy language below.""You may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin. If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of legroom. If no volunteer is forthcoming and seat are available in another class of service you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service.""D.The regulatory language should also include a provision that seating with additional floor space for a service animal shall be provide on a priority basis to people with disabilities with service animals and only provided to people with emotional support animals when there is no need for such seating by a person with a service animal. It should be noted that service animal users specifically service dog users have great concerns about large numbers of people with poorly trained emotional support animals being allowed on aircraft. Many of these dogs prove to be dog aggressive while service dogs are typically trained to never show aggression. A confrontation between a dog aggressive emotional support dog and a non-aggressive service dog can result in permanent harm to the service dog who might then be unable to work effectively around other dogs. Additionally with airlines designing cabins with very little space for service animals a broad inclusion of people with mental illnesses who are not disabled but who wish to travel with their emotional support dogs creates an uncomfortable competition for the limited available space. If it is the desire of DOT to broadly define the class of people with emotional support dogs who can bring their dogs into the passenger cabins of aircraft then DOT should also require additional seats in aircraft that have the floor space for such dogs without creating a competition through scarcity. It is Unacceptable that the DOT mandated by Congress to regulate the airline industry in a manner that provides equal access to air travel for people with disabilities seems more interested in protecting the revenue stream of the airlines at the expense of equal access. The NPRM if it was to become a final rule will prevent many people with disabilities who are unable to afford two coach seats or a business class or first class seat any access to air travel. People with disabilities with legs that cannot bend will be forced to purchase more expensive seats or two coach seats or they simply will not be able to fly. People with disabilities with service animals will be forced to purchase seats in more expensive classes or to purchase two seats. Those with disabilities who cannot afford to pay more than is required of any other passengers will simply be denied air travel. Of the more than 2000 people with disabilities with service dogs I know of no person including myself  who would place their service dog at risk by having their service dog flown in a baggage or cargo compartment where animals routinely suffer stress beyond what is necessary become ill or die in transport.3. The term ""facility"" should apply only to the aircraft itself and not to any parts of the airport terminals or boarding areas including ticket counters customer service counters check in gate counters jet ways or other boarding devices. The ADA Accessibility Guidelines provides minimum requirements for counter heights widths of paths of travel maneuvering clearances ramp slopes etc. The regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation published to implement the requirements of the ADA provides minimum requirements for wheelchair lifts. In the years since the effective date of the Air Carrier Access Act airlines have continued to have built counters too high for use by people with disabilities. Airlines have continued to have built jet ways with sections too steep for use by people with disabilities who use wheelchairs and with ramp sections (with slopes exceeding 5 percent for distances greater than 6 feet) lacking handrails. Violations of the ADA can be addressed by private lawsuits in federal court. There is no such right provided by the Air Carrier Access Act. By transferring the requirements for accessibility within the built environment of airports from the ADA to the ACAA this regulations will take from people with disabilities our right to enforce minimum access standards within the built environment. Historically the U.S. Department of Transportation has not been effective in addressing these issues within airport terminals.  4. The failure to require accessible lavatories on aircraft with only one aisle has resulted in many people with disabilities being unable to travel by air. People with bladder and/or bowel issues that are part of their disabling impairments continue to be denied equal access to air travel due to the lack of aircraft with accessible lavatories. The requirement for accessible lavatories should not be based on the number of aisles of an aircraft but on the seating capacity of the aircraft. The Department should determine the number of seats lost to the provision of an accessible lavatory and should then determine at what number of seats the loss of that number of seats would not result in an undue financial burden. I suggest  that in aircraft with 200 or more seats that an accessible lavatory should be provided.5. The dimensions for the space for storing a folding wheelchair in the passenger cabin of aircraft are not sufficient for many folding wheelchairs. The standard clear floor space requirement for a stationary wheelchair is 30 inches wide and 48 inches deep. When a wheelchair is folded the width is reduced but not the length. Therefore the dimensions should be the 13-inch width and the 36-inch height but the length should be increased from 42 inches to 48 inches. Additionally the dimensions should be stated as width length and height so that airlines do not attempt to provide a space that is only 36 inches long but 48 inches high. An alternative of strapping a folding wheelchair into seats and bumping passengers as necessary is not a reasonable alternative to providing an actual storage space for a folding wheelchair. This opinion is based on the history of airlines violating the requirements of the Air Carrier Access Act in the past. If an airline was to refuse to provide this alternate folding wheelchair storage location claiming that the seats are sold the passenger with a disability will be confronted with a choice of not flying on the scheduled flight or risking damage to the wheelchair placed in baggage. Airlines are well known to give people seeking a CRO for assistance the choice of deplaning and missing the flight or accepting the violation of their rights. Anything that replaces a built in means of compliance with a staff provided means of compliance simply invites violations.6.. I have grave concerns over the section concerning requiring passenger with disabilities in the following quoted passage to fly with a safety attendant.     (2) A passenger who because of a mental disability is unable to comprehend or respond appropriately to safety instructions from carrier personnel including the safety briefing required by 14 CFR 121.571(a)(3) and (a)(4) or 14 CFR 135.117(b) or ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices as applicable;    (3) A passenger with a mobility impairment so severe that the person is unable to assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft;    (4) A passenger who has both severe hearing and severe vision impairments if the person cannot establish some means of communication with carrier personnel adequate to permit transmission of the safety briefing required by 14 CFR 121.571(a)(3) and (a)(4) 14 CFR 135.117(b) or ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices as applicable.    (c) If you determine that a person meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(2) (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section must travel with a safety assistant contrary to the individual's self-assessment that he or she is capable of traveling independently you must not charge for the transportation of the safety assistant. However if a passenger voluntarily chooses to travel with a personal care attendant or a safety assistant that you do not require you may charge for the transportation of that person.    (d) If because there is not a seat available on a flight for a safety assistant whom the carrier has determined to be necessary a passenger with a disability holding a confirmed reservation is unable to travel on the flight the passenger is eligible for denied boarding compensation under 14 CFR Part 250 if Part 250 applies to the flight.    (e) For purposes of determining whether a seat is available for a safety assistant you must deem the safety assistant to have checked in at the same time as the passenger with a disability.    (f) Concern that a passenger with a disability may need personal care services (e.g. assistance in using lavatory facilities or with eating) is not a basis for requiring the passenger to travel with a safety assistant. You must explain this clearly in training or information you provide to your employees.This passage is says that an individual with a disability is essentially incapable of assessing their own ability to travel independently and makes no mention of who is then qualified to assess this and how they are to assess it. As a person who uses a wheelchair and a service animal I am subject to many peopleеХs assumptions including that I am paralyzed. I am not paralyzed and have been traveling alone since the age of eight. Yet this passage now seeks to tell me that I am now less capable of traveling alone than I was when I was eight based upon someoneеХs assumptions about my physical capabilities. I find this assumption in and of itself blatantly discriminatory.Secondly I believe that by instituting this policy will open the airlines will lose unnecessary seats and experience a new level of fraud from people who are not disabled but see a way for a companion to fly free. Particularly since it is illegal to ask someone what his or her disability is and many serious disability cannot be seen.Next many people with disabilities who fly for a living would loose their jobs because employers would not be willing or able to cover the added travel cost of the safety attendant. Finally this section suggests that disabled passengers are in danger when they choose to fly. Flying continues to be the safest form of transportation however the institution of this policy clearly says that flying is dangerous. For the reasons stated  I find all of the above-proposed rules achieved more discriminatory practice towards disabled people not less and should not be implemented as written.

All of PVAеХs members are еТindividuals with disabilitiesеУ under the ACAA and have a significant interest in the strongest possible implementation and enforcement of the ACAA.  Virtually all PVA members use wheelchairs for mobility and many fly frequently on official PVA business.  PVA employees board of directors and advisory committee members travel frequently enough to require the use of an in-house travel coordinator.  It is critical to the successful conduct of PVA business that air carriers fully understand their obligation to comply in every respect with the ACAA.  PVA believes that the Department's proposals promote clarity in understanding of the mutual obligations of air carriers and passengers with disabilities under the ACAA.  The question and answer format of the proposals appears to be a useful change while retaining the compulsory nature of regulations.  These comments will address the issues according to the order in which they are raised in the NPRM.Section 382.3:  What Do the Terms in This Rule Mean?PVA urges the Department to modify the term еТFacilityеУ to include rolling stock that belongs to the carrier.  Access to many regional jets and other planes is provided by a shuttle from the terminal.  These vehicles must be accessible to people with disabilities including people who use wheelchairs.Section 382.5:  To Whom Do the Provisions of This Rule Apply?As stated in the preamble the Department proposes ""to cover only those flights operated by a foreign air carrier that begin or end at a US airport.  Aircraft accessibility requirements would apply only to those aircraft that are used for these flights.""  PVA understands that this proposal is premised on the Department's view that ""it would exceed the scope of the Department's authority to attempt to apply ACAA requirements to all the operations of a foreign air carrier.""  PVA supports the Department's proposal particularly in light of its explanation of what constitutes a flight that ""begins or ends at a US airport"" and the definition of what constitutes a continuous journey on a segmented flight.Section 382.7:  What May Foreign Carriers Do If They Believe a Provision of a Foreign Nation's Law Precludes Compliance with the Provision of This Part?PVA understands the need for a waiver provision for foreign carriers but is concerned that this exception will eventually swallow the rule.  Therefore PVA strongly supports the proposed regulatory language expressing the exacting standards to which the Department will hold a foreign carrier seeking a waiver.Section 382.15:  Do Carriers Have To Make Sure That Contractors Comply With the Requirements of This Part?PVA strongly supports the proposed language codifying the Department's interpretations of provisions governing the relationship between contractors and air carriers.  These provisions are that contractors (including airports) must meet the same requirements that would apply to the carrier itself in providing the services in question that a contractor's noncompliance is a material breach of its contract with the carrier that the assurance must commit the contractor to complying with all applicable provisions of the rule with respect to all activities performed for the carrier that the carrier remains responsible for the contractor's compliance and that carriers cannot defend against DOT enforcement actions by saying that their noncompliance was the contractor's fault.With the development of website travel agencies new options have opened up for air travelers.  These websites are important contractors with airlines that must be accessible to people with disabilities.  In this regulation these must be included either in the definition of еТindirect carriersеУ or clearly specified as contractors.  Either way they must comply with the accessibility guidelines in 36 CFR Part 1194.25.The Department seeks comment regarding its interpretation of paragraph (c) of proposed section 382.15 that as drafted it would apply only to U.S. carriers with respect to U.S. travel agents.  The Department's rationale for not proposing to cover foreign airlines or foreign travel agents under this provision is that rules concerning relationships between U.S. carriers and foreign travel agents or foreign carriers and their travel agents could prove very difficult to monitor and enforce.  PVA understands the difficulty in monitoring the actions of foreign travel agents but does not agree that they should be entirely exempt.  Domestic carriers may provide reservation systems for use by travel agents.  Those that do generally provide a daily bulletin of information for travel agents.  Foreign travel agents are responsible for a great deal of trips that end or begin in the United States and must be made aware of these provisions.  Domestic and foreign carriers must provide via websites phone lines or brochures information about the substance of this rule particularly as it applies to indirect carriers to foreign travel agents with whom they deal.  At the very least the Department should accept complaints regarding behavior of foreign contractors and comment to the best of its ability on the legality of the foreign contractorеХs actions under the ACAA.Section 382.19:  May Carriers Refuse To Provide Transportation on the Basis of Disability?The Department proposes language that ""would clarify the basis on which an air carrier may deny transportation to a passenger. In addition to updating the citations to statutory and regulatory provisions that provide a basis for excluding passengers from a flight . . . the NPRM uses the concept of еФdirect threatеХ as the standard for when a carrier may conclude that there is a safety basis for excluding a passenger from a flight.""PVA disagrees with the introduction of this concept into the regulations.  Specific FAA or TSA safety regulations must continue to be the sole source of discretion for air carriers who think it necessary to exclude passengers with disabilities or take other action on the basis of safety.Over the years PVA has had to refute arguments from the airline industry that people with disabilities threaten their own and others' safety in air travel.  Past efforts by the industry to limit the number of mobility impaired passengers make evident that the concept of  еТdirect threatеУ is liable to be misused and to deny transportation to people with disabilities.   In the stressful and hurried air travel context such instantaneous determinations by carrier personnel are likely to be at best subjective and could rise to the level of blanket categorizations.   There is no evidence to support the idea that refusal should be permitted on any basis other than safety or violations of federal regulation.    In our view introducing the concept of ""direct threat"" would inevitably lead to greater denial of transportation.Should the Department introduce the concept of ""direct threat"" the regulatory language must make it clear that the direct threat is limited to a potential threat to the health and safety of other passengers and not to the passenger himself.  Air carriers must not be permitted to substitute their judgment for that of the passenger with a disability.  The Department should be mindful of Chevron v. Echazabal 536 US 73 (2002).  In Chevron the Supreme Court upheld anEqual Employment Opportunity Commission regulatory provision for the ADA that allows employers to consider a threat to self reason to refuse to hire applicants with disabilities.  The Supreme Court interpreted the regulation in this manner despite the fact that in the language of the ADA Congress recognized a direct threat defense only for dangers posed to other workers.Section 382.29:  May a Carrier Require a Passenger With a Disability To Travel With a Safety Assistant?PVA does not object to the NPRMеХs use of the term еТsafety assistant'' rather than the term еТattendant'' in current Section 382.35.  We are concerned however with the explanatory language that ""A safety assistant is someone who accompanies a passenger with a disability in order to provide assistance in the event of an emergency such as an evacuation of the aircraft.""  Our concern is premised on the practice of some air carriers to require quadriplegics and others with severe mobility impairments to travel with attendants simply because they may not be able to physically assist with an emergency evacuation to the satisfaction of air carrier personnel.  The Department should make clear its long-standing policy that so long as a passenger with a disability can communicate to others how best to physically assist him in the event an evacuation is necessary he should be free to travel unaccompanied.Section 382.43: Must information and reservation services of carriers be accessible to individuals with hearing and vision impairments?The Department asks in this section whether passengers with disabilities should be able to request accommodations through carrier websites.  PVA strongly supports this requirement.  Carriers offer special fares and frequent flyer offers through web booking.  While a passenger with a disability could make a reservation online (providing the site is accessible) it is not usual practice because any request for particular seating or transfer assistance must be a separate telephone call.   Online request for special services provides both the passenger and air carrier personnel written records of the request and response which is not generally available when the request is made by phone.  Adjusting websites to incorporate this provision is a reasonable step for carriers and provides passengers with disabilities equivalent use of this convenient means of booking.Section 382.51:  What Requirements Must Carriers Meet Concerning the Accessibility of Airport Facilities?PVA believes that domestic carriers should continue to comply with ADAAG accessibility standards in foreign airports to the extent that it does not interfere with foreign regulations or standards.  Consistency is very important to all passengers and for the most part should be required where feasible.Kiosks have become a common and sometimes preferred means of checking in at the airport; in fact some carriers provide only kiosks with agents available for assistance.  It is critical that kiosks are accessible to people with disabilities including those who use wheelchairs and those with vision impairments.  Kiosks should meet spatial and reach ranges specified in revised ADAAG Section 707.  Communications aspects should be covered by ADAAG 707 and 36 CFR 1194.25 as the Department suggests.Section 382.55:  What Requirements Apply to Carriers' Security Screening Procedures?Proposed Section 382.55 recognizes that the Transportation Security Administration now controls security screening at U.S. airports and that there may be foreign legal requirements for security screening at foreign airports that are not subject to ACAA regulation.  However the proposal also anticipates the possibility that some air carriers may choose to conduct security screening procedures that go beyond those carried out under TSA or foreign legal requirements.  Consequently for such additional carrier-imposed procedures the Department proposes to carry forward the substance of current Section 382.49 and seeks comment on whether this is necessary.  PVA believes that it is necessary to carry forward the current language especially if Congress should once again privatize security screenings.Section 382.61:  What Are the Requirements for Movable Aisle Armrests?PVA strongly supports paragraph (c)еХs explicit statement that movable aisle armrests must be provided proportionately in all classes of service in the entire passenger cabin.  As stated in the preamble ""if 80 percent of the aisle seats on the aircraft in which passengers with mobility impairments may sit are in coach and 20 percent are in first class then 80 percent of the movable aisle armrests must be in coach with 20 percent in first class.""  This express regulatory requirement is long overdue.PVA also strongly supports the Department's proposal to remove the current exception for types of seats in which incorporating movable aisle armrests would not be feasible.   PVA has not seen evidence showing that any particular sort of seat truly makes the use of movable aisle armrests infeasible.  PVA membersеХ experiences support the DepartmentеХs belief that this exception has led to a lack of movable armrests and therefore a lack of accessibility in some classes of service for some carriers.PVA also requests that the location of these movable armrests be easily determinable particularly to flight personnel.  Years ago representatives of the air transportation industry indicated that once they were required movable armrests would be placed on all seats save a few.  This has not turned out to be the case though PVA cannot perceive of a reason it could not be so.  Movable armrests are virtually indistinguishable from others and do not fold up as easily as those on inside seats.  Our members have sat in boarding chairs waiting as flight attendants go up and down aisles trying to locate and then operate a movable armrest.    PVA requests that in this section or elsewhere flight personnel be specifically trained in the operation of movable armrests and if they are not universally in place a diagram of their locations be available on board.Section 382.63 What Are the Requirements for Accessible Lavatories?This section carries forward the requirements of current Section 382.21(a)(3).  It would make explicit that carriers may but are not required to install accessible lavatories in single-aisle aircraft.  PVA appreciates the DepartmentеХs recognition that the absence of accessible lavatories on single-aisle aircraft can create inconvenience and difficulty for many passengers with disabilities. The Department seeks comment on whether it would be desirable and feasible practically and economically to require accessible lavatories on at least some new single-aisle aircraft (e.g. those above a certain seating capacity).PVA supports rulemaking requiring accessible lavatories in new single aisle aircraft of at least 100 seats or aircraft undergoing total reconfiguration.PVA participated in a DOT Federal Advisory Committee in the mid-1990s for designing onboard lavatories in single aisle aircraft.  With a single exception the aeronautical engineers from major manufacturers were able to design this accessibility into existing aircraft.  Aircraft manufacturers clearly stated in this exercise that they would/could design anything the carrier requested as long as it was structurally viable.PVA recognizes the burdens of imposing new costs on economically fragile air carriers but believes that it is time that this provision be seriously considered and implemented.  Section 382.67:  What Is the Requirement for Priority Space in the Cabin To Store Passenger Wheelchairs?In 1991 PVA commissioned a study on appropriate dimensions for a storage space for a folding wheelchair.  After consultation with each major manufacturer and the ANSI/RESNA wheelchair standards committee the recommendation was made that adequate dimensions would be 43еУ long 14еУ wide and 40еУ high.  Unless new information has been developed PVA believes that these dimensions would be more accurate than those specified in the regulation.  PVA would be glad to provide this information to the Department as needed.The Department also seeks comment on whether the proposed rule should codify its current enforcement policy permitting ""carriers to comply with the requirements for passenger wheelchair stowage space across two or three seats using a strap kit approved by the FAA rather than to retrofit an aircraft possibly involving the removal of seats to provide the designated wheelchair space.""PVA accepts this practice as an effective means of satisfying the requirement for existing aircraft but believes that it is not and should not be the only feasible means of stowing a passengerеХs wheelchair on board on planes that have yet to be constructed or have seats installed.  The final rule should require a designated protected area that is capable of accommodating a passenger's folding wheelchair in each new or reconfigured aircraft.Section 382.81:  For Which Passengers Must Carriers Make Seating Accommodations?Section 382.83:  Through What Mechanisms do Carriers Make Seating Accommodations?Section 382.85:  What Seating Accommodations Must Carriers Make to Passengers in Circumstances not Covered by Sec. 382.81 (a) Through (d)?These sections carry forward the requirements of current Sec. 382.38 restructured for greater clarity. The Department seeks comment on whether other seating accommodations should be added to fill gaps if any in the existing provision.  In the initial rulemaking seats with movable armrests were designated to be available to anyone using a boarding chair.  We strongly urge that DOT require that bulkhead seats also be available for reservation to passengers using personal wheelchairs.  PVA members have been refused the opportunity to reserve these seats in advance and told to call back within 24 hours of the flight and/or arrive at the airport early.  Upon taking either of those actions our members find that bulkhead seats have been assigned to other passengers and have no access to them because it is not specified in this regulation.Wheelchair users can frequently get into bulkhead seats without having to use a boarding chair if they are able to get down the first class aisle in their personal wheelchair.  Avoiding those extra transfers and the awkward maneuvering down the aisle in a boarding chair (once referred to as a еТnecessary evilеУ by an air carrier representative) makes the boarding process safer and easier for both passengers and personnel.  We strongly recommend that bulkhead seating be made available to wheelchair users upon request.  At the very least those seats should be able to be reserved by wheelchair users with the proviso that should passengers with a either a service animal or an immobilized leg require that seat the wheelchair user could be bumped.Section 382.91:  What Assistance Must Carriers Provide to Passengers With a Disability in Moving Within the Terminal?The proposed rule contains requirements concerning assistance in moving through the terminal other than in connecting flight situations.  The Department seeks comment on whether in the situation where a passenger is arriving at an airport to begin a journey it is reasonable for the carrier to be able to require advance notice for meeting the passenger to provide the assistance required in this section.PVA generally objects to advance notice requirements unless extreme or unusual provisions are requested.  We understand the logic of advance notice for service to be provided upon arrival at an airport.  If this regulation imposes this requirement it should reflect as in other provisions the requirement for the carrier to provide the assistance without advance notice if it can do so without delaying the flight.  A more critical service for wheelchair users is access to their personal wheelchairs when feasible for transfers to connecting flights.   Many travelers even with extended layovers have been told that their own wheelchair cannot be brought to them but must be transferred directly to the connecting flight.  This leaves them basically stranded and reliant on carrier personnel for any activity including use of the bathroom during a layover.   PVA believes that providing a personal wheelchair enables passengers to travel more independently and does not impose an undue burden on the carrier.  Any time limitation on providing this accommodation for a layover should require carrier personnel to check on possible delay of connecting flights.Another service that must be provided for wheelchair using passengers is accessible intraterminal transportation.  Mobile carts are used in most airports to transport passengers with long distances to gates and yet these carts are still not accessible to wheelchair users seventeen years after enactment of the ACAA.  Wheelchair users must either push or be pushed extensive distances while ambulatory passengers ride by on carts.  Carts whether owned by the carrier or a contractor must be required to provide access to wheelchair users.Section 382.93:  Must Carriers Offer Preboarding to Passengers With a Disability?PVA concurs with the DepartmentеХs belief еТthat providing a preboarding option for passengers is an essential accommodation for seating stowage and other activities that are more difficult for passengers with disabilities than other people.еУ  In light of the requirement for preboarding for the opportunity to store a personal wheelchair on board we believe that carriers must offer this service.  PVA supports the NPRMеХs proposal to require a preboarding opportunity for passengers with disabilities.Section 382.95:  What Are Carriers' General Obligations With Respect to Boarding Deplaning and Connecting Assistance?The Department seeks comment on whether the requirement that carriers provide this assistance ""promptly"" should be more specific (e.g. by including a time frame or by requiring that carriers ensure that deplaning assistance is provided to passengers with disabilities who will use an aisle chair for deplaning no later than the time that the aircraft aisle is clear of other passengers such that the aisle chair can be brought to the passenger's aircraft seat).  PVA agrees with the DepartmentеХs objective to address the many situations in which passengers who need assistance in deplaning have been left on board aircraft for an unreasonable length of time but are concerned that any specific designation will become a maximum performance standard.  That is that if a time limit of 15 minutes is specified (which PVA believes is too long in any case) that timing will become the common practice among carriers.  We strongly object to any reference to the time that all other passengers have left the plane.PVA does not disagree with the use of the word ""promptly"" or its flexible application in a multitude of circumstances.  We suggest that regulatory guidance be included in the final rule explaining that ""promptly"" means as soon as needed even if the plane is not empty of other passengers.  We note that passengers needing assistance with transfers to connecting flights would be hugely affected by any reference to the aisles being clear of other passengers.  People who use wheelchairs are forced to sit even when passengers have been requested to wait to allow others with tight connections to exit the plane first until the last passenger is off.  They frequently miss flights that others on the same flight are able to make due to this practice.   There is no current requirement in the regulation that essentially requires that all other passengers be off the plane before the passenger with a disability is able to deplane; PVA objects to that practice being accepted by the Department much less put into regulatory language.We also request the Department to clarify that boarding assistance includes assistance with transfers to and from the boarding chair if accepted or requested.  We recently heard from a person who was informed that airline personnel were not required to assist a passenger in getting out of his seat and in fact that he needs to bring his own assistant to do so.  While we believe this is unusual and such assistance is generally provided  the Department should specify that transfer assistance is required by this part.We also urge the Department to specifically require that vertical access from the terminal to the tarmac be located as close to the plane as possible so that people with mobility disabilities who must change levels by elevator are not forced to move a great distance to their plane or shuttle.  Section 382.97:  To which aircraft does the requirement to provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts apply?PVA recently had a report from a member of an elderly relative who used a scooter that was raised in a boarding lift while in her scooter.  At that point she was informed that her scooter could go no farther and she had to walk across the boarding platform to the plane.   Understandably this upset her terribly and she was terrified while making that crossing.  She changed her return flight so that she would not encounter this problem again.  When asked that she be informed in the future when this type of boarding would be required she was told that they could not ensure that a lift would not be used.  We believe that the Department should include this information in Section 382.41(c) as information that must be provided to passengers with disabilities.   More importantly we believe that the Department must specifically require that passengers needing to use a lift to board an aircraft be secured in boarding chairs unless they refuse that accommodation.Section 382.131:  Do Baggage Liability Limits Apply to Mobility Aids and Other Assistive Devices?The Department seeks comment on how liability for loss of or damage to wheelchairs and other assistive devices should be handled in the case of international transportation since the domestic baggage liability limits of 14 CFR Part 254 as well as the exception to these limits that this section in effect creates do not apply to international transportation.  The Department should simply assert that the same rules that apply to domestic carriers for calculating the compensation for a lost damaged or destroyed wheelchair or other assistive device apply equally to foreign air carriers.  If foreign air carriers believe that Warsaw or Montreal Convention liability limits dictate a different result they are free to apply for a waiver under proposed Section 382.7. Section 382.141:  What Training Are Carriers Required To Provide for Their Personnel?The NPRM would add a provision requiring the development of training in consultation with disability community organizations. The Department seeks comment on the application of this proposed requirement to foreign carriers.  PVA would not object to the Department waiving this requirement if a foreign carrier can demonstrate it made good faith efforts to contact disability community organizations in its home country but was unable to do so.Section 382.143:  When must Carriers Complete Training for their Personnel?PVA believes that one year is adequate time for foreign carriers to complete their training but that the deadline for domestic carriers should be six months.  The substantive changes in this regulation are not complicated ACAA training is a regular part of carrier training and carriers do refresher training on a regular basis.  It is not an undue burden for domestic carriers to provide targeted training to the appropriate personnel on the changes in this rule within six months.Section 382.145:  What Must Carriers Incorporate in Their Manuals?The NPRM would delete the requirement of current Section 382.63 for carriers to establish ACAA compliance programs and submit them to the Department for review.  Instead the NPRM would require all carriers to incorporate their procedures for complying with ACAA requirements in their manuals training materials and guidance for their personnel and make them available to the Department on its request.PVA does not object to the requirement to incorporate their procedures into their manuals but believes that the Department rather than reviewing manuals only upon request should require at least an initial submission of that manual for review.  A simple submission of certification of compliance is insufficient to ensure compliance with this part.  Section 382.151:  What Are the Requirements for Providing Complaints Resolution Officials?PVA agrees with the Department that ""In any situation in which a person raises a disability-related issue and a carrier's personnel do not resolve the issue immediately to the customer's satisfaction the carrier's personnel must immediately inform the customer of the right to contact a Complaints Resolution Official (CRO).""  Despite repeated attempts to make ACAA information available PVA members and many others with disabilities are unaware of the existence of or responsibility of CROs.  Experience has shown that even carrier personnel are unfamiliar with this term and with the requirement to make the ACAA regulations available and will locate to their manager only if specifically requested.  PVA supports the requirement that the airline make passengers aware of this resource when a passenger's disability-related concern has not been addressed to the customer's satisfaction by the carrier's staff.ConclusionPVA appreciates the opportunity to respond to the issues raised by the Department and supports the Department's strong advocacy for equal access to the skies.

Dr. Schwartz has been training in correctional institutions for over twenty five years has been a consultant to many different State Commissioners and has recently been appearing all over the country in court testifying as an expert witness.Barbara Schwartz has had polio since she was two years of age and currently has been experiencing more difficulty in ambulation . Since the acquisition of Thomas her remarkable training dog who knows over eighty commands she has been able to travel to her places of work.It disturbs me to learn that the Department of   Transportation has currently proposed that disabled persons must now pay for a service animal for the seat adjoining them or be placed in the cargo of the plane. The former would be prohibitive for an active working person who travels by plane once or twice a month. The only possible reason for such a proposal would be  financial concerns of the airplane industry. It is difficult to imagine that these matters should be passed onto the shoulders of the disabled. It also seems that this proposal would fly in the face of the stipulations of the disability act.  The latter proposal to place Thomas in the cargo is ludicrous and bizarre. It can only be written by individuals who are not familiar with service dogs. I would hope that the Department of Transportation would be willing to re-consider this proposal or meet with individuals with disabilities to understand fully what the outcome will mean. I would hope that the Department of Transportation will be willing to drop this proposal whose only purpose can be to save the industry a few more dollars.The IADDP is suggesting an alternative proposal which would еТoffer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin. If no seats are available in that class of service you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room. If no volunteer is forthcoming and seat is available in another class of service you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service.""

106,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-04-29T23:59:59-04:00,NA,Florida Department of Transportation Comments and Response to the U.S. Department of Transportation еТNotice of Regulatory ReviewеУ (Docket No. OST-2005-20112-1)Thank you for the opportunity to suggest regulatory revisions that will improve the effectiveness of existing rules and identify new rules that may be needed.  Our recommendation relates to 23 CFR 750.707 issued by Federal Highway Administration which deals with outdoor advertising control.  We believe that the current regulations accurately reflect the intent of Congress in 1965 when the Highway Beautification Act (Title 23 U.S. Code Section 131) was initiated.  However the passage of forty (40) years has demonstrated that the regulations prohibiting modifications to nonconforming signs guarantee continuation into the foreseeable future of unsightly and old outdoor advertising signs adjacent to the National Highway System and frustrates stateеХs attempts to reduce the number size and height and to improve spacing distance between these signs.We appreciate your consideration of this suggestion.Kenneth M. Towcimak DirectorOffice of Right of WayFlorida Department of Transportation Recommendation:The Florida Department of Transportation recommends that 23 CFR 750.707 issued by the Federal Highway Administration be modified to remove specific requirements prohibiting the modification of nonconforming outdoor advertising signs and that a provision be added requiring that each state develop its own requirements for control with the objective of 1) reducing the overall number of nonconforming signs and 2) improving the appearance of roadways on which nonconforming signs remain.Discussion:The Highway Beautification Act 23 USC е¤ 131 (HBA) was developed with the intent that nonconforming signs would be removed by requiring the states to purchase them.  To facilitate this funding was to be provided so that the Federal share of the required sign compensation would be 75% of the cost.  So strong was this provision that specific language was included providing that unless the Federal funds were made available the removal requirement was tolled.  Because of the basic premise that nonconforming signs would be purchased and removed nothing in the HBA itself addresses the long term policy toward nonconforming signs.  It simply assumes they will cease to exist.Federal funding for purchase of nonconforming signs has never been made available in amounts necessary to substantially reduce the numbers of these very expensive structures.  Even at the time of the original drafting of the Federal Regulations in 23 CFR Subpart G it had become apparent that the Federal share would not be forthcoming anytime soon.  However in anticipation of the future funding the regulations in 23 CFR 750.707 were written from the standpoint of prohibiting changes to the nonconforming signs so that their value would not be enhanced and the required level of future Federal funding for purchase increased.After almost forty (40) years it is doubtful that the extremely large amounts necessary for the Federal share of funding for the removal of nonconforming signs in the states will be forthcoming.  Although ISTEA included provisions allowing states to use their general highway appropriations for the removal of nonconforming signs the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1992 inserted language in 23 USC е¤ 131(n) making it clear that the use of such funds for this purpose is a state prerogative and is not the еТFederal shareеУ which would trigger the nonconforming sign purchase requirements of the HBA.  The effect is that Congress has stated that the purchase and removal of nonconforming signs is purely at the discretion of the state.  In addition the regulatory assumption that the cost of structural materials in the sign constitute the major factor in the signеХs value does not consider the widely varying national methodology for determining the value of nonconforming signs.  Several state courts have ruled that valuation of the signs for purchase must consider the income producing potential of the sign not just its depreciated reproduction cost.  Where such a rule is in effect as in Florida the current regulations on sign modifications do little to control the value of the signs.  Under this method of valuation the important issue is the amount of traffic passing by the sign that is its view potential not the nature of the construction materials in the sign.Although the regulations had a valid purpose at their initiation that purpose no longer exists.  Rather than providing a mechanism for the states to improve highway beautification the current regulations place barriers in the way of statesеХ highway beautification efforts.  Regulations intended to control the cost of acquisition now preserve the status quo and impede highway beautification efforts where eliminating and moving nonconforming signs is required.Signs actively maintained under normal industry standards will exist in perpetuity.  By requiring signs to remain еТsubstantially the same as it was on the effective date of the State law or regulationsеУ and without providing funding to remove them the regulation ensures that these unsightly old signs will continue to exist into the future.  Achieving effective highway beautification in this circumstance is extremely difficult for the states.In announcing the America the Beautiful initiative in January 1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson said еТI want to make sure that the America we see from these major highways is a beautiful America.еУ  Although the HBA was the cornerstone of this initiative it should not be forgotten that the original goal was the beautification of highways not just the elimination of signs.  Considering that the removal of nonconforming signs by purchase is discretionary with the state and state laws regarding valuation methods vary the reasonable conclusion is that the states should be given the opportunity and flexibility to develop their own regulations for dealing with nonconforming signs within the overall objective of achieving the original goal of the HBA the beautification of highways.,DOT-OST-2005-20112,Notice of Regulatory Review,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2005-20112-0043,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Florida Department of Transportation Office of Right of Way,2005-04-29T00:00:00-04:00,Kenneth Towcimak,Florida Department of Transportation ,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Budreau President of the board of commissioner in Benton County.  A public hearing was held on August 29th at 6:30 PM at the Benton County Court House to discuss and listen to the publics wishes regarding which time zone would best serve the citizens of Benton County.  Supplies and goods are shipped equally in our estimation to the West and East.  TV and radio are received from both Illinois and Indiana (Indianapolis and Chicago) along with local radio.  No bus or rail is availble in the County. These services would be available in both Lafayette In. and Danville Il. Lafayette being a few miles closer. Equal distance between O'Hare Airport in Chicago Il. and Indianapolis Int. airport in Indianapolis In.(100 miles one way to each) Midway Airport is actually the closest regional airport just south of Chicago Il. Approximately 60% of commuting residents commute to Tippicanoe County and the other 40% commute to Newton White Warren and Fountain Counties in In. and Iriquois County in Il. We are a very rural agricultural county with very little industry with a stable population since the 2000 census. Weather and commodity prices determines much of our economy.  Benton County has several churches to serve our residents.  We have a newly constructed consolidated elementary school next to our county consolidated high school which was consolidated in 1968.  Health care is available within our county.  We have Dr.'s in 3 of our 5 small incorporated towns. (Fowler Otterbein and Oxford) Hospitals used are in Tippicanoe County Warren County and Iraquois County in Hoopston Il.  Benton County has had petitions located at the Benton County court house since August 29th and the results of those petitions are as follows.  23 for Eastern 59 for Central and 14 for which ever Tippicanoe County chooses located to our Southeast.  As President of the Benton County commissioners I have collected information from businesses and citizens that reflect a vast majority requesting Benton County to go with Central Time.  Since I am an elected official I feel it is my responsibility to petition to the DOT that Benton County go with Central Time Zone.  It is a very difficult decision as we do have more citizens commute to Tippicanoe County and it was just reported that Tippicanoe County is requesting Eastern Time Zone.  Our local TV news does come from Tippicanoe County as well as a Daily paper.  However many Benton County residents do receive weekly newspapers from Benton County White County and Iriquois County in Illinois. I am requesting the DOT to issue a NPRM on the behalf of Benton County and its citizens who responded to the time zone issue.  This issue has put myself as well as my fellow commissioners in a very difficult position.  We hope you will respect our request and allow a Benton County a public hearing.

110,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-09-15T23:59:59-04:00,NA,"9-15-05--Indiana should remain on Eastern STANDARD time year round and not go on daylight savings time.--Indiana is on the west edge of the Eastern time zone and there is quite a difference of sun rise and sun set times in Indiana and the sun rise and sun set times that affect those states further east in the Eastern time zone.  It can be as much as two hours difference.--People say moving Indiana to daylight savings time will ""save"" energy costs.  That is simply not true as we will incur the same expenses for the early morning hours energy useage that many people will incur as they get up and about.  The early morning people will forever be in the dark and not get to enjoy the early morning sunlight.  Not everyone operates on ""banker's hours.""--The Indiana state representatives/congress people and the Washington-wanna-be-governor state it is essential to go on daylight savings time for business purposes and to keep up with the companies and other states in the Eastern time zone.  Geesh!  What utter nonsense.  With the internet conference calls/meetings email fax overnight delivery etc. the business folks should be able to coordinate their schedules to get done what they need to during the business day.  If not let THEM adjust their work hours and quit messing with the lives of the rest of us!  --I guess the businesses governments and economy of all states west of Indiana aren't able to properly function since they're not in the Eastern time zone. --With the forced change to daylight savings time the kids will be going to school in the dark/morning dusky dawn which makes it more dangerous for the kids.  I guess the kids aren't as important as the business people having their extended evening sunlight hours.--As it is now as of late August through mid-September and beyond we are already not seeing any sunlight until almost 7:00 AM or later.  On cloudy days it is even worse.  With daylight savings time it will be almost 8:00 AM or later before we'll have sunlight and there'll be kids already out waiting for busses and/or walking to school in the extended morning darkness.  So much for the professed concern and care for the children eh?--With the extension of daylight savings time to begin in March and extend through to the end of November morning daylight matters will be even worse.  It may help those on the eastern portion of the Eastern time zone but not those of us on the western edge of the Eastern time zone.  For that matter it affects each ""east edge v. west edge"" time zone in that manner.--With the forced change to daylight savings time the extended light during the evening hours is desired by business people for golf or other social events.  How many of those business people will extend their evening work hours.  Not many if any.  They just want more play time.  It's not actually about business it's the play time/party time they want.--Locally the county officials had to hold a public meeting for ""citizen input"" although they had already decided to submit their response for the county to go on daylight savings time.  The citizens knew their input would not matter and few appeared at the meeting.--The entire issue of Indiana going on daylight savings time should have been put to a vote for all citizens of Indiana to have a true voice in this touchy subject.  However despite appeals to do so Indiana's representatives/congress people would not put the issue on the ballot for a referrendum vote by the citizens of Indiana.  Talk about legislation without TRUE representation!--Hopefully the issue of daylight savings time will be reviewed in upcoming sessions of Indiana government and either put on the ballot for a referrendum vote by ALL citizens of Indiana or somehow get the 2005 legislation overturned and keep Indiana on Eastern STANDARD time.  Then our state won't have to be divided into sections of Eastern and Central times.--And just why do people find it so hard to accept Indiana being on ""standard"" time while others are on ""daylight"" time?  To ""conform"" to daylight savings time just so folks don't have to know the time is silly.  Do we all want to be sheep and follow the crowd?  --Kudos to Arizona and Hawaii for standing their ground and not caving in to daylight savings time!!--The issue of Indiana on daylight savings time would have been moot had the representative not gone against his word given to his constituents that he would not vote for it; at the last minute much to the detriment of the folks he said he would ""represent"" he turned tail and voted for daylight savings time.",DOT-OST-2005-22114,Time Zone Boundaries in the State of Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2005-22114-0210,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-09-15T00:00:00-04:00,Karen Van Every,Karen Van Every,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is also more than clear; that the average Hoosier adult is for Central Time for all of the human reasons.               Indiana clearly has had a long-term problem of which time zone it wants to be in because businesses have been very greedy in wanting both DST and Eastern Time even though we are no where near the Eastern Time Zone Line!       However it is the vote of the people that will eventually count the most.               With the addition of 5 more weeks of Daylight Savings Time to be imposed on us by the FEDs this will put the Indiana sun coming up at about 8:20 a.m. in November of 2007; this is entirely out of place and will become unacceptable to most Hoosiers.         It is my projection that if the State of Indiana is not placed into the Central Time Zone as a large percentage of Hoosiers want we may again re-live the history of the early 1970s.      In the Early 70s Indiana was placed on DST by the state legislature the people of Indiana were not happy with DST on EST and they forced the legislature through public outcry to take Indiana out of DST the following cycle.              It is the greed of the Fortune 500 type of companyеХs that may well put an end to Day Light Saving Time in Indiana for the second time.

All I've read are a bunch of people whining that traveling with oxygen is too expensive and that someone else - the airline - needs to be burdened with the cost. ...... <<< Not quite >>>> any business is NOT burdened with costs that can be passed onto the consumer.  Granted the airlines are not doing this as they are too busy positioning themselves for great profits in the future.  The basic class in Econ 101 - the lemonade stand - was missed by the airlines and employees.  When your Mom gives you the lemons sugar water and cups - no kid opens on the corner PAYING CUSTOMERS TO HAVE A DRINK.  Conversely the airlines are very knowledgeable on how to milk corporate welfare for every dime they can get from taxpayers and the traveling public.  YS:   Oh yes and that nice group of people was kind enough to cut-and-paste the same worthless prepared statement over and over again. Thanks so much for that - you really brought a lot to the table.............<<<<< A fact of life can only be stated in a limited number of ways and still retain the facts.  The nice group is simply agreeing with the obvious truth.  I will bring more to the table more than your half truths and many erroneous thoughts and statements.  YS:   Not. NEWS FLASH - LIFE ISN'T FAIR. THINGS COST MONEY. <<<< you are so right.  A point that has been missed by the airline community.  Airports and the infrastructure for airline travel cost billions of dollars that collectively the airlines canеХt possibly come up with.  Taxpayers many of which need supplemental oxygen to travel with pony up the dollars and indenture there cities to pay for these facilities.  The airlines then COLLECT the money to help repay this incredible expense.  A term that you seem to miss is called еТcost of goods soldеУ.  The airlines do NOT ask shareholders or employees to put up the cost of landing fees and using an airport or airways facilities.  The taxpayers put it up first and then each ticket has the expense tacked onto it.  No discrimination to any airline.  They each pay based on weight of aircraft which reflects the number of passengers they can haul onto a specific airport.  This is NOT the case the consumer that needs supplemental oxygen they are over charged for this еТserviceеУ or told not to ride the airline at all - EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE PAID TAXES TO PROVIDE A LANDING POINT.  Clearly a case of еТWhites onlyеУ in the window of the restaurant.  Those signs came down in the south but still exist in the airlines.  YS:  If you cannot afford a service - and that's what this is - then you simply go without........<<<< Having a lavatory onboard an aircraft is a еТserviceеУ.  I havenеХt seen any pay locks on the toilets.  You can still get a special meal (on those that still serve them) by asking for it when you book.  How nice no extra charge.  The meal will be delivered to the plane with your name on it.  Should you have a heart problem on board and need a difibulator there is one on board and a FA that supposedly knows how to use it oh the costs of training.  How nice a еТserviceеУ at no charge.  Should you need a wheel chair look in the coat closet every airliner carries one on every flight.  The FA is required to get a person that needs help getting to the toilet by doing everything but holding it for the passenger.  How nice a еТserviceеУ at no charge. YS: If that means you travel by bus or - gasp! - don't travel at all then so be it. It is NOT the responsibility of the airline industry to accomodate customers with supplemental oxygen. Some airlines do and they charge a fee to cover the costs of their service. Believe me they are NOT taking money home in wheelbarrows from it. If they were don't you think EVERY AIRLINE would offer oxygen?!?<<< oh contraire. People that need supplemental oxygen have a еТresponsibility to pay taxes to pay for the guaranteed payment of all this infrastructure for 20 - 30 years and you are saying the airlines donеХt have a responsibility to permit them to ride on the airline.  Great logic. Every Airline that opts out of making it available is a low ball low cost carrier.  For the most part they are lucky to get a bag to baggage claim and management didnеХt want to burden them beyond there limited capabilities.  They hide behind the rule when it was set up for oxygen that permitted airlines using small 12-15 passenger airplanes not to have the heavy old bottles in them.   YS:  ....they do not carry the extremely hazardous pressurized O2 that you get from your tank at home.<<< Not quite.  Each airline contracts with a local supplier to provide filled tanks.  The oxygen is processed in the same manner whether it goes on a plane or to a customers home.  Filled by exactly the same process and еТoxygenеУ that the portable oxygen bottles on every commercial jet are filled in accordance with.  The portable bottles in the cabin and in the cockpit ARE NOT considered еТhazardousеУ.  YS:   By the way want to know why the airline oxygen costs so much? Let me educate you on just some of the reasons:<<<<< your еТeducationеУ leaves a lot to be desired.  It has been proven that the world is not flat.   YS: 1. It's special reduced-humidity O2 and not the stuff you get at home <<< not true - medical oxygen is processed exactly the same whether for home airline or hospital.  Humidifiers are provided at the point of use.  YS:  2. Each tank is carefully monitored to ensure structural integrity. We can't have even the SLIGHTEST possibility of a valve stem breaking off and having that O2 cylinder turn into a shiny metal torpedo streaking through the cabin of the plane.<<< quality control is done by the supplier that also supplies home oxygen.  Legally they do not want a еТmetal torpedo streaking throughеУ a house.  The electric generated units in this еТRule MakingеУ that have been approved by the FAA are not pressurized.  In addition the small personal liquid oxygen units weigh less than 10 pounds when filled (far less than most carry ons) and are under minimal pressure and have a pressure relief port in the event of a depressurization.  Welcome to the 21st century.  Neither unit can become a еТmetal torpedoеУ and are therefore safer.  But in regards to safety it has been proven for 30 years that having supplemental oxygen in the passenger cabin is safe as in no fatalities from supplemental oxygen.  The airlines proved by killing a number of passengers that it was unsafe to carry the chemical generating containers in the cargo bin.  YS:  3. The airline has to handle and ship the tanks for you - per Federal Aviation Regulations! This pulls airline employees from the jobs they'd normally be doing and costs the company a LOT more money.<<< not the case at all - the SUPPLIER ships the tanks to the airline they are not picked up at the drive through by the airline.  Suppliers do ship in accordance with Federal laws that are acceptable to the FAA...  YS:  Your affliction - as sad as it is - is NOT a disability and is not covered by the Air Carrier Access act. Stop trying to wrap yourself up in the ""But it's a disability!"" rant because it's not.<<<< Hello - ALL other branches of government DO consider it a disability.  Even under definitions of еТdisabilityеУ by the FAA in FARеХs the need for supplemental oxygen IS A DISABILITY.  If you havenеХt noticed the disabled stickers and parking places ARE given to people on supplemental oxygen not to marathon runners.  It is not covered by the Access act as the airlines have a powerful lobby.  I suppose you also donеХt consider it total discrimination that people of Japanese ancestry were forced to sell and give away all their property and locked into camps during WW 2.  But of course it was OK at the time because the Federal Agencies at the time said it was the thing to do.   This proposal had best be passed and rather quickly.  The lawsuits are waiting in the wings and will end up costing US taxpayers a sizable sum of money.  That will look good on a resume when the present Feds are out looking for a job. I am a retired Airline Pilot that flew when traveling on a plane was a treat instead of a treatment. Back in those days the airlines lost money and MADE money.  Then along came deregulation and guess what about 50% of all available airline seats are now operated in bankruptcy......  еТCheapеУ is not always the best deal............ Stop this incredible discrimination and pass this Rule MakingеУ and mandate the use of personal liquid oxygen units on all airlines.

113,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-10-11T23:59:59-04:00,NA,I am so glad to see that the International Air Transport Assoc. wants more time to develop еТtheir factsеУ concerning safety and costs.  The safety concern is as apple pie as Motherhood no one dare said anything against the dread safety aspect no matter how erroneous it may be. Safety - Fact1.  Airlines have been providing supplemental oxygen in the passenger cabin for years on 1st rate airlines with NO safety problems.Note: These have been the old style heavy metal oxygen bottles that are continuous flow. This amendment proposed is dealing with the NEW type of supplemental oxygen generator that does not store oxygen.2.  Not included in this amendment but should be are the personal liquid oxygen bottles that are far safer than the old bottles proven safe by use for 30 some years.The LOX bottles are safer than the presently used bottles as they are under a far smaller amount of pressure like 20 psi versus 2000 psi plus. They have a pressure relief valve in the event of an airplane depressurization.  They weigh less than 10 pounds and are less of a threat to safety during turbulence than most carry on luggage in the cabin.  Most important they can be set on demand and cannot be emptied all at once to become a terrorist threat like a another method (s) I can think of and I am not even a terrorist looking for a method.  Cost - Adding the new electric oxygen generators should cost about the same as the heart defibrillators as they are similar in price.  Perhaps even less as the training for the FAеХs will be less.  Less cost than carrying a wheel chair on every commercial airliner on every flight everyday for how many years?  Weight on any airplane in motion is paid for by added fuel burn.  Interesting that the airlines have unilaterally added the heart defibrillators and the wheel chairs at no cost to those that use them.  Yet for people with a disability of needing supplemental oxygen the airlines have NOT filled that need on every commercial flight at no cost.  Oh I forgot the government  in there wisdom did not get the need for supplemental oxygen covered in the Disabilities Act. Great job of lobbying by the airlines.   In the rest of the world a person needing supplemental oxygen IS considered a disability.  With the airlines catering to еТsomeеУ disabled passengers unilaterally we now have a clear cut case of discrimination in the civil courts.  Here is a way to eliminate any extra costs for the еТover burdenedеУ airlines.  Add to this amendment the portable oxygen bottles such as Helios and Spirit.  That way a passenger would provided his own oxygen that would take him from curbside to the plane through the flight and to curbside on arrival.  These and other units can provide oxygen for anywhere from 4 hours up to 20 hours which give the passenger the independence they want and of course the joy for the airlines of NO COST.  We do not need any further delays in implementing this amendment and adding the portable bottles.,DOT-OST-2005-22298,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Medical Oxygen and Portable Respiration Assistive Devices,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2005-22298-0113,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-10-11T00:00:00-04:00,James Actor,James M.

Currently I only have Michigan to deal with for about 1/2 the year due to the daylight savings time. Now there saying that St.Joseph county may go to Central Time and Elkhart will stay Eastern. Now if that happens now not only will I have to deal with Michigan but also Elkhart. That means that my customers in Michigan and Elkhart will have to go without support for an hour due to the time change (7:00am in Mishawaka=8:00am in Michigan and Elkhart). In order for me to cover that hour I would either have to pay my employees OT which I don't like or they will have to come in at 7:00am which they don't like plus if I go to a 7-4 time then my client in St.Joseph county will have no support from 4:00-5:00pm.

As a teacher I find that so many children already are  sleep deprived and struggling to stay awake in class. With the sun setting later at the end of the day ( with eastern daylight time) the children will be going to bed even later than now and have greater difficulty in getting  up because it will be darker in the morning. If we are so concerned about providing optimal conditions for learning then having a time zone that does not tempt people to stay up later is best. Many adults as well suffer from sleep deprivation so why encourage everyone to stay up later at night?  I would imagine that sleep deprived employees cost businesses millions of dollars not to mention the accidents that are a result of tired drivers workers etc. If we can not be on central/ central daylight time then let's stay the way we are and drop the idea of daylight savings.

123,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-11-14T23:59:59-05:00,NA,This e-mail is to express my concerns about the time zone issue now facing St. Joseph County Indiana. My main concern is a state-wide one related to how business and transportation occur on a nationwide scale. As I understand it the goal of IndianaеХs being put in a given time zone and moving back and forth from standard to daylight time like virtually everyone else is so that other states know what time we are on because we move as they do twice a year and this will make it easier to do business with Indiana.  It seems to me that еТcarving upеУ the state between Central and Eastern times anymore than it already is will only confuse those in business and transportation services around the country all over again. For example if St. Joseph County is placed on Central time it becomes different from counties to our south and east and from Michigan immediately to our north. Someone in say Texas or New York must somehow know not just that we are in Indiana but that for reasons he/she doesnеХt care about we are not on eastern time like virtually all the rest of the state.  Of course Indiana already has a few counties actually adjacent to business centers such as Chicago that follow those time zones and that no doubt may confuse out-of-state business persons even now. If such persons have to make themselves aware of even more deviations that seem to exist for no obvious reason (we are in the exact CENTER of the state after all) I canеХt help but think it would not help Indiana in interstate commerce but hinder it. The state should be in one time zone with--I suppose--the exceptions that already exist--in order to truly be as much as possible in sync with most of the rest of the country.I am a freelance writer and at times need to call and receive calls from editors in all kinds of time zones. I canеХt imagine their reaction if thinking Indiana is generally in this or that time zone they call only to find they had the time wrong. I also occasionally take part in conference calls and it would be puzzling to those who set them up as well. My interstate dealings are small and still I do not look forward to the prospect of having to deal with this confusion. I can only imagine what larger businesses would face.My preference for IndianaеХs actual time zone would be Eastern for reasons no doubt already cited by thousands of other e-mails. But in any case pleas do not attach St. Jos. County to the northwest corner! (Once again--we are not even in the western part but in the center of the state.) Place us on the same time as the rest of the state. ItеХs the only solution that would be a solution!Thank you.Sincerely yoursPamela H. Peterson936 Simon CourtSouth Bend IN 46615P.S.I am also intensely concerned about what being singled out this way may mean in terms of confusion for many aspects of life if St. Joseph Co. opts to go to Central time and that is approved. St. Joseph and Elkahrt CoеХs truly are ONE economic unit with huge numbers of workers going both directions to work and home each day. Shopping business education and many others activities flow back and forth between these two populous counties. Having lived in both Elkhart and South Bend I am aware of this first-hand.

It has been more than difficult each year to deal with the semi-annual adjustment that our difference as to Daylight Savings Time has created.

Anyone that has any consideration for the economy of this area would want to be in unison with the counties to our south and east. St. Joseph County government leadership wanting us on Central Standard Time is all politics. If this change had been recommended and passed by a Democratic Governor and State Leadership we guarantee you St. Joseph County would endorse Eastern Standard time for this County. But since it was done by a Republican governing body they would never approve it regardless how much it will ruin our economy.Let'shope the U.S. Department of Transportation will not be persuaded by polititions of St. Joseph County and will consider the financail well being of this County and the area.Mr. & Mrs. Robert Kaehr5326 South Lee CourtSouth Bend IN  46614 ,DOT-OST-2005-22114,Time Zone Boundaries in the State of Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2005-22114-2541,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-11-18T00:00:00-05:00,Anonymous,Rebecca L.

As an attorney it is difficult to coordinate schedules with courts of different counties with two different time zones proposed.  I actively practice in St. Joseph County Elkhart County Marshall County LaPorte County Lake County Starke County and others.  Seminars are frequently held in Marion County. I think it is imperative that regardless of the zone chosen that the entire state be on the same time.  I'd prefer Central.  Add to the mix the following: My working hours start at 7:00 a.m. in St. Joseph County. My husband who works in Elkhart County takes our two kids to preschool each morning. They cannot be to preschool earlier than 7:30 a.m. Therefore if St. Joseph and Elkhart County are split on time zones he will no longer be able to take the kids and my hours will of necessity have to change.  Indiana already has a tough enough time with the rest of the country thinking we're backwards - isn't this adding fuel to the fire.

Warsko12256 Settlers Cove CourtGranger  IN  46530I am strongly in favor of Eastern Daylight Savings Time Zone for St. Joseph County IN.  The officials in the State of IN must continue to strive to make this a better place to live and work.  It appears the Chamber of Commerce and several local businesses are looking at the economic benefit of St Joseph County staying in the Eastern Time Zone.  It also appears the local politicians are looking at a political issue of getting even with Mitch Daniels (Governor of IN) for promoting Daylight Savings Time.  Recommendations should not be made on a selfish political basis but rather on what is best for the community. Studies have been conducted that show a greater number of employees travel between St. Joseph County and the counties to the East and South and also to the State of Michigan than from the neighboring Western counties and the City of Chicago.  Let us promote a healthy economic area by staying in the Eastern Time Zone. Energy will be conserved if we have the extra hour in the evening.  In a world where family values are constantly challenged let us help families play together.  Families do not play together at 5:00 in the morning. By keeping the St. Joseph County in the Eastern Time Zone families will have that extra evening hour to shoot hoops ride bikes play ball etc. without adding extra cost for outdoor lighting. During the winter months with Eastern Time the sunsets at 5:21 PM EST.  If St. Joe County would change to Central Time Zone the sun would be setting at 4:21 PM.  Winter is a dark time of the year in this area with little sunshine.  It does not make sense to compound the problem. Let children come home from school with a little extra daylight hours remaining. For both economic and lifestyle reasons I strongly believe Eastern Time would be best for Elkhart and St. Joseph Counties.MARIE WARSKO,DOT-OST-2005-22114,Time Zone Boundaries in the State of Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2005-22114-2885,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Individual,2005-11-21T00:00:00-05:00,Marie Warsko,Marie Warsko,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

According to the Indiana Child Support Agency in Indiana DOT isn't going to do anything...as I was told that contacting the DOT 'wouldn't do any good'.Instead of worrying about time zones the DOT needs to start pulling the support orders of Indiana truck drivers involved in accidents/fatalities if they want to see where a real danger is.,DOT-OST-2005-22114,Time Zone Boundaries in the State of Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2005-22114-3293,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Crowe Chizek and Company LLC,2005-11-22T00:00:00-05:00,Renee' Thomas,Renee' Thomas,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We get lawyers and litigants from all over the Midwest and indeed the entire country coming here for legal proceedings.  In the past the fact that most of Indiana did not observe Daylight Savings Time caused great confusion for many people coming here but at least that problem has been put to rest by the state legislature's recent action.  We will still have lawyers and litigants members of the public showing up for trials and other legal proceedings an hour early or an hour late unless you standardize the time zone for the entire state.  If that cannot be done at least keep St. Joseph County in the Eastern Time Zone since we are surrounded on three sides by states and counties that are on Eastern Time.

136,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-11-29T23:59:59-05:00,NA,After considering this proposal for some time I believe that there are two issues that the DOT needs to address in making an affirmative decision on the proposal.  The first is the approval of specific devices by brand and model.  There are already a number of devices especially in the cpap autopap and bi-pap field that have been approved for use by major international airlines such as Qantas as well as the FAA.  There is a need for airlines to be provided with lists continually updated of approved products. There is also a need for airlines to be required to maintain the updated list either electronically or in a hard copy format at each airport gate where they will be boarding passengers.The other issue I think needs to be addressed is the legal issue.  I have a strong feeling that the legal departments at the airlines have been taking a very conservative approach to devices such as the cpap.  By prohibiting all use they feel they will avoid litigation related to an inability to provide power or having the devices fail.  It may be very helpful for the DOT to provide standardized procedures for use of these devices and if the airline is in compliance with these procedures to provide the airline with protection from litigation.  Procedures such as pre-boarding and testing the power outlet (and providing a different seat if the power outlet does not work) will go a long way in accommodating the needs of both the airlines and the passengers.,DOT-OST-2005-22298,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Medical Oxygen and Portable Respiration Assistive Devices,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2005-22298-0382,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2005-11-29T00:00:00-05:00,Ken McLaughlin,Ken McLaughlin ,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I lived in La Porte County (Central Time Zone) and attended law school at Notre Dame (Eastern Time Zone)  I would regularly have to leave my home at 6:00 a.m. to get to an 8:00 class in South Bend.  (It is a 45 minute trip).  While this was a hassel for me during my education it is a real detriment in conducting business throughout the State of Indiana.  Our office hours begin at 8:00 a.m. that means anyone in the majority of the State of Indiana cannot contact us until 9:00 a.m.  There is a two hour block in the day during the lunch hours for Eastern and Central Time that it is nearly impossible to conduct business and at the end of the day most of the state closes an hour before we do.  In addition with the difference in time during elections most important races are called for Indiana prior to the closure of the polls in La Porte Lake and Porter Counties.

The statements are bogus because no mechanism has been made available to most Hoosiers to express their preference. In fact the Republican leadership has made clear its opposition to a referendum that would put this ""clear preference"" to the test.

Nevermind that he sat on his hands until the eleventh hour before offering an opinion to the public and to the USDOT.Forget all that stuff for now. He is breaking the law. The Daylight Saving Time bill added a section to the Indiana Code that specifically required the state to support a county executive's efforts to switch time zones. Instead of supporting the St. Joseph County Commissioners as the law requires Mitch Daniels is opposing their efforts. This is simply outrageous. He wasn't ignorant of that provision of the law. His spokesperson was recently asked about it and offered up an explanation of that provision with which only an illiterate could agree alleging that the provision required support only of the process not the county executive seeking to change time zones.

I was given the opportunity to speak but I would like to supplement my comments with additional information that I was not able to present in the allotted 3 minutes.I would also like to cite additional letters --many of which have already been posted to the DOT website--which buttress the ""convenience of commerce"" argument in support of Central time.This includes statements from: еб  Steel mills in Northwest Indiana-USX and you have previously received the letter from the General Manager of IN/Tek-In-Koteеб  Trade association-the Metal Service Center Institute with headquarters in the Chicago areaеб  The largest steel distribution Coop with headquarters in the Chicago area-NASAеб  Customers such as Lapham-Hickey Champion Resources of Chicago; Case Corporation in Fargo North Dakotaеб  Suppliers of materials including metal banding (Signode Corporation--Chicago area) and contractors (Shoffner--LaPorte In)You have received a thorough letter from our traffic manager Mr. Marvin Jurjevic regarding the disadvantage we will face in securing trucking services which primarily emanate from the Central Time zone.  Another important factor is impact of product that moves from the Port of Indiana at Portage Indiana. Hundreds of thousands of tons of steel is imported into the Midwest through Portage Indiana.  Many of these tons are shipped into St. Joseph County.  By forcing St. Joe County to go to Eastern Time we are in effect penalized by one hour every working day of the year.  We cannot begin to pick up material and ship into South Bend Mishawaka or Elkhart without losing time and money.  This also restricts the total amount of product that we can bring into our facility.  Much was discussed about rail traffic.  The South Shore can speak for themselves as they make a compelling case regarding the link between Chicago and our county.  In addition there is very important information and data found in the INDOT website that speaks to the importance of our link to Chicago (2.0 Current Rail System in Indiana) in which it states ""The current rail system in Indiana is structured to primarily handle east-west traffic flows across northern Indiana to and from ChicagoеУ ...(my italics).  Further in the study there are also important points made about ""future intercity rail passenger service Indiana would be served by the Federal Railroad Administration's presently designated high-speed routes between the western hub at Chicago (my italics) and Detroit Cleveland Cincinnati and Cleveland.""  There are obvious benefits of using rail to help address the national goal of reducing fuel consumption and costs and to promote growth into our state. Furthermore if one was to review Table 2-3 еТIndiana Rail Freight Commodities in 1999еУ you would see that the railroad transported 11.6 million tons of Primary Metal products which originated in Indiana.  Although I could not find the specific geography of where the steel moved from it would make sense that it originated from either the Port (Portage) USX (Gary) Mittal (Indiana Harbor) In Tek (New Carlisle) or perhaps Nucor Steel (Crawfordsville)--virtually all in the central time zone.  Once again the connection to points west--Central time-- are compelling.   The service and distribution business is extremely vital to our economic well being.  According to MACOG St. Joe county enjoys a growing service and distribution economy and jobs.  Businesses such as Tire Rack Town Air Freight and Woodwind/Brasswind ship and do business all over the country.  Being placed in the ""time zone"" center of the country is an economic benefit to those growing businesses and their employees.  In fact it can easily be argued that many places of business in the Eastern time zone do not even start until 9:00 am so that first hour of the day presents a sub-optimal option compared to later in the day.Our legislators were told that the state would be required to support the decision made by the counties.  The pressure that the Governor is placing on DOT to rescind the valid petition is an insult to the local constuents and our elected officials.  The logic that the Governor uses is odd:еб  Every county is entitled to petition in accordance with its best interest.еб  Except when your neighboring county disagrees with you.еб  Then you must forgo your interest and do what is best for your еТregionеУ.  Furthermore this decision will NOW be taken out of your hands.LetеХs take a step back to understand how we got to where we are today.In response to why State Senator John Broden voted in favor of Daylight Savings Time he commented that еТAnother critical factor in determining my favorable vote for this legislation was the fact it requires that the Governor petition the federal Department of Transportation to conduct hearings to determine where the time zone boundaries should be drawn in Indiana.  Further the legislation requires the State to support any county in its efforts to seek a change in its time zone if the local elected officials of the county believe the county is in the wrong time zone.еУ  And so the process began.  Our County St. Joseph County was charged with the responsibility of determining what is best for their constituents.  Here is a basic time line of events that took place:еб  Saint Joseph County was 1st to file a letter with the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) on May 26 2005 signed by the mayors of South Bend and Mishawaka.еб  Saint Joseph County was 1st to hold an open public meeting on June 29 2005 at the Century Center.еб  Resolutions were discussed voted on and passed by a majority the following governmental bodies:      oCity of South Bend Common Council July 25 2005      oCity of Mishawaka Common Council August 15 2005      oSaint Joseph County Council August 23 2005      oSaint Joseph County Commissioners September 13 2005еб  On October 31 2005 the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) tentatively granted Saint Joseph Counties petition for Central Time Zone status.As we examine what makes common sense (it is said that there is nothing common about common sense) St. Joe County should be in the Central Time Zone.  LetеХs look at some basic facts:еб  7 months of the year we were already on Central Time (people can call it Eastern Standard Time but it is really Central Time).  It will be a very simple transition to increase from 7 months to 12 months.еб  The Federal government has divided the country into regions and most regional offices for all of Indiana are in Chicago including:     oUS Department of Justice     o7th Circuit Court of Appeal     oHUDеб  Travel еР We support our local Michiana Regional Airport however there are significant problems with the number of airlines servicing our airport.  We are often forced to drive to Chicago in order to fly to our destination.  The South Shore is also linked to the Central Time Zone with South Bend being the only stop in a different time zone.еб  Media еР We support our local newspaper television and radio however we often receive our news from Chicago newspapers television and radio.What about the benefits to business?I will speak about our business - Steel Warehouse Company Inc.  We are a Steel Service Center with a significant manufacturing and distribution commitment to our area and we are located on South BendеХs west side.  In addition our South Bend facility is the corporate headquarters for processed steel tubing and fabricated products with facilities in South Bend Rock Island IL Oak Creek WI Portage IN Memphis TN and Conway AR.Here are some of the numbers:еб  Continuous ownership and operation in South Bend for close to 60 years.еб  Total Employment in South Bend 708 (including Steel Warehouse and Lock Joint Tube)еб  Total Employment Corporate 1552еб  Annual Payroll $33000000 (for the South Bend facility only)еб  Taxes $887000 (Real Estate and Personal Property)In the past 40 years our city and region were ravaged by loss of manufacturing jobs.  Gone are Studebaker Bendix Brake and Allied Products (South Bend Stamping division).  Businesses like South Bend Range and South Bend Toy have also left some relocating to the South.  And so for us to grow and survive we must follow the businessеЙmost of which is toward the greater Midwest and the South.  We are fortunate to count among our customers many fine companies like Caterpillar Case International Truck and John Deere ALL located in the Central Time Zone.  There is also significant business growth in Wisconsin (Racine is the corporate headquarters for Case) Iowa Minnesota (Crenlo / Division of Dover Industries) and points west and southwest.  This growth enables us to have a significant work force and capital investment in St. Joe County.How much steel is shipped in to our business?еб  Our annual corporate spend is close to 1000000 tons     oThat equates to 12500 rail cars еР 52 per day                         Or     o50000 truckloads еР over 200 per dayThat is a tremendous amount of merchandise coming in to our facility.  Most of which is from steel mills whose facilities and offices are located in the Central Time Zone.And what about our employees?  We must be immune from the commuter issue (I am not trying to demean this problem) but out of 498 employees at Steel Warehouse there are 31 that reside in LaPorte Porter or Lake County and only 3 reside in Elkhart.We do business in both time zones.  However in order for us to service our customers to the West we would need to keep people here until a minimum of 6:00pm.  That means that they do not get home to their families for supper or school events until at least 6:30pm.  When you factor in family time helping with homework and attending school activities it is simply to late in the evening to get it all done.Conversely our employees are more than willing to come in at 7:00am to handle commercial requirements for customers who are in the Eastern Time Zone.  So our normal workday of 8:00am еР 5:00pm would be sufficient IF we were on Central Time.We implore the DOT to allow the petition that was submitted in a fair democratic process by our County political leaders to remain in the Central Time Zone.PleaseеЙdo not put us a good corporate citizen at a competitive disadvantage.  We are in a very competitive environment and we along with our valued employees are looking to grow because we are in a global economy.  Yes with all respect we all of us are looking beyond our County or Counties.There has been significant testimony by political leaders of Elkhart County of the time zone that makes sense for them.  They are entitled to consideration provided by the DOT as they look to be in the Eastern Time Zone.  Their position which they feel is appropriate to their self-interest should not override what has been done in a fair and democratic way in St. Joe County.We donеХt think it is good representative government to allow one county to in effect have a veto power over its neighbors.We are all for cooperation but we are all against capitulation.In summary letеХs understand the opportunities and realities for growth to the West and the South.  LetеХs focus on a broader and greater economic unit not just Michiana.  LetеХs be inclusive and invite all of our good county neighbors to be a part of the potential economic prosperity and realities by reconsidering their own time zone to join this greater economic unit.LetеХs stay together if we can and become more successful more dynamic and a more united economic region in the Central Time Zone.Please excuse the length of this request.  I know that you have been besieged with data and that you are doing the best job possible to be fair. But in the end it gets down to this:еб  Does the county know what is in it's best interest -- in spite of the rhetoric of aneighboring county--or is the best decision (which has already been granted onceby the DOT) to overturn the process that was outlined by State law and take it away from the local constituents?еб  Does the GovernorеХs last minute plea for еТunityеУ in the North-Central Indiana region require that our county needs to accept the еТlowest common denominatorеУ or whichever zone is best for itеХs neighbor to the East in order to preserve that еТunityеУ?  (Please remember the pleas of officials from Marshall and Fulton Counties to be aligned with St. Joe County on Central time.)еб  In the overall scheme which allows some counties to be the еТedgeеУ of that time zone why isnеХt St. Joe county allowed to be that Eastern most edge in the Central time zone?We hope you consider these arguments and uphold the previous decision to grant St. Joseph County the right to determine that Central Time serves our area better than the alternative.SincerelyMichael LermanPresidentSteel Warehouse Company Inc.",DOT-OST-2005-22114,Time Zone Boundaries in the State of Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2005-22114-4200,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Steel Warehouse Co.

Norman Mineta Secretary Dear Mr. Mineta:I am a resident of South Bend Indiana and I currently work and live in St. Joseph County.  Our county commissioners and the mayor of South Bend have petitioned the Department to designate this area in the central time zone.I urge you to grant this request.  As a business person with clients in the Midwest and West I have found the central time zone the most ""forgiving"" when dealing with customers outside the zone.  There is just  one hour difference to account for east one hour difference with those on Mountain time and two for those  on Pacific.  In addition the entire state of Indiana falls into the Central time zone region and the federal agencies that serve our state are for the most part based in Chicago (the Social Security Admin. the Federal Court system Immigration offices etc.)  Business is conducted with these agencies daily.Finally Gov. Daniels supports the eastern time zone stating that it will attract and keep business in Indiana.  Unfortunately  for our citizens the facts do not support this.  Although Indiana will be on DST next year  businesses continue to move from the state at an alarming rate including several manufacturing-based businesses moving from Elkhart County.  (Elkhart County St. Jospeh County's eastern neighbor has chosen to keep eastern time and is trying to impose its will on St. Jospeh County as well.) Many  of these businesses are moving to states in the Central time zone or offshore.  The management of these companies apparently find no economic advantage tied to the time zone but rather to the wage and educational levels of the labor force.  In addition  there  is no quantitative or qualitative evidence that one single company will move here based upon the Eastern time zone.Based on above it seems clear that the entire state should be on the Central time zone.  But since this is not the process to be followed as determined by Gov. Daniels I urge you to grant St. Jospeh County's  request to move to the Central time zone.  Thank you  for your  consideration.RespectfullyMarianne BlackPrincipalMaxx Communications",DOT-OST-2005-22114,Time Zone Boundaries in the State of Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2005-22114-4532,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,MAXX Communications,2005-11-30T00:00:00-05:00,Marianne Black,Marianne Black,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Having St Joseph county in the Central time zone would be extremely inconvenient.  We would have to cope with two different times year round.  The debate in Indiana has always been about whether there should be daylight saving time not which time zone.  The daylight saving time debate has been rested with the decision to go with daylight saving time for St. Joseph county in Indiana.  The primary backers of Central time in the county seem to be politicians who maybe trying to court the business vote in the area.  The residents are more in tune with the Eastern time zone and have been living that way for many years.  Please do not switch St. Joseph county to the Central time zone.  Thank you.

150,DOT,FALSE,0,2005-12-01T23:59:59-05:00,NA,I would strongly appeal to the DOT to set South Bend and the county in the Eastern Time Zone.  As a businessman and resident of Michigan I find  it very difficult to work out scheduling of appropriate tests or to cross the state line.  The city seems to think it is more closely aligned with Chicago than Michigan.  It would be interesting to see how much commerce comes from Berrien Cass and Van Buren Counties to the area.  It would also be advantageous to my children to be able to see the national news in the morning.  We get virtually no Michigan news or national news as we are solely dependent on South Bend for local broadcasting.  This is a disservice to the education and maturation of Michigan Children.  I urge you to put St. Joseph county in the Eastern Time Zone.  Robert C.

For example is there a priority determined as to projects? What about the deteriorating conditions and/or life spans of projects are these considered? I would also want to ensure money is distributed equally between states to ensure that the entire amount isn‰ЫЄt allocated to projects in only one or two states? Ultimately I believe that having such criteria for the allocation process is extremely important as it will allow you to give an explanation of why you have denied/approved someone for funds and will cut down on the appearance of bias. Likewise is there an appeal process for the individuals denied qualified highway or surface freight transfer facility funds? Simply saying you‰ЫЄre denied when there is no set criteria and at the pure discretion of one person doesn‰ЫЄt usually sit well and or seem right without some sort of appeal process in place. It also seems troubling that the Department states ‰ЫПThe Department is not specifying any form for an application.‰Ыќ I do believe that uniformity in the application process would not only be easier for the applicant but also be more cost efficient for the individuals on the other end who are processing such.

152,DOT,FALSE,0,2006-01-05T23:59:59-05:00,NA,We do not believe that Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act 42 U.S.C. 2000d provides authority for this guidance or for the underlying Executive Order.  We suggest that OST ask the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel for an opinion on this matter since it involves not only OST but many other Executive Branch agencies as well.The validity of our comments is buttressed by a Supreme Court decision Alexander v. Sandoval 121 S. Ct. 1511 (2001) that was handed down since the guidance first became effective on the last full day of the Clinton administration January 19 2001.  The events of last September 11 2001 also make this a good time to reassess the wisdom of executive-branch pronouncements that inevitably encourage the balkanization of the nation into ethnic enclaves.Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits еТdiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistanceеУ against any person in the United States еТon the ground of race color or national origin.еУ  The guidance acknowledges that еТOn its face Title VI prohibits only intentional discrimination.еУ  Sandoval reaffirms the Supreme CourtеХs earlier pronouncements that Title VI bans only disparate treatment not actions that have only disproportionate effects on this or that racial or ethnic group.There is obviously a problem then if a federal agency promulgates regulations purporting to implement Title VI but that ban not only disparate treatment (which Title VI is aimed at) but also actions with only disproportionate effects (which the Supreme Court has said that Title VI allows).  The Court has long recognized that the difference between disparate treatment and disparate impact is one of kind not just degree.  See e.g. Washington v. Davis 426 U.S. 229 (1976).  Since a federal agency cannot even ban intentional discrimination without statutory authority see NAACP v. FPC 425 U.S. 662 (1976) then it would certainly seem to lack authority to ban actions that are not intentionally discriminatory when they have no statutory authority to do so.While the Sandoval decision did not invalidate Title VI disparate-impact regulationsеСthe Court concluded that the issue had not been presented to itеСfive justices on the Court strongly hinted that they might vote to do so in a future case.  The Sandoval majority noted еТWe cannot help observing еЙ how strange it is to say that disparate-impact regulationsеУ properly implement Title VI when the statute еТpermits the very behavior that the regulations forbid.еУ  The Court also noted that Title VI еТlimits agencies to еФeffectuat[ing] rights already created byеУ it.  See 121 S. Ct. at 1516-17 1519 n.6 1521.  See also Thomas A. Lambert The Case against Private Disparate Impact Suits 34 Ga. L. Rev. 1155 1211-21 (2000) (discussing inter alia the CourtеХs еТgeneral rule that agency regulations may not be more prescriptive than the enabling statutes under which they are promulgatedеУ id. at 1214). Since Congress cannot transform a disparate-treatment ban into a disparate-impact ban see City of Boerne v. Flores 521 U.S. 507 (1997) it seems fair to conclude that a federal agency also lacks this authority.  The Court in Boerne said that CongressеХs font of authority Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment does not give it authority to make this fundamental transformation; a fortiori an agencyеХs font of authority Title VI does not give it authority to make this fundamental transformation.  See Lambert 34 Ga. L. Rev. at 1218-21.Such a transformation is additionally problematic because a ban on disproportionate effects will in fact encourage race-consciousness and disparate treatmentеСthe very behavior that Congress sought to ban.  See Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio 490 U.S. 642 652-53 (1989); Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust 487 U.S. 977 992-94 & n.2 (1988) (plurality opinion); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody 422 U.S. 405 449 (Blackmun J. concurring in judgment).  Finally to the extent that Title VI regulations are applied to states (as they frequently are) problems are raised under Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon 473 U.S. 234 242 (1985) because Congress has not approved such incursions on state authority let alone approved them еТunequivocally.еУ  And were Congress to have given agencies authority to rewrite the statute actually passed problems are raised under the nondelegation doctrine as well.The justification for the disparate-impact approach is scanty and typically relies on one or more of three Supreme Court cases none of which is on point.  The first Alexander v. Choate 469 U.S. 287 293-94 (1985) was not a case about Title VI or its regulations; instead it involved the Rehabilitation Act which the Court was at pains to assert might well give agencies broader authority to promulgate disparate-impact regulations.   The other majority opinion sometimes cited is Lau v. Nichols 414 U.S. 563 568 (1974) but there is no discussion in this case at all of any regulationеХs validity and in any event when Lau was decided the Court had not yet determined that Title VI banned only disparate treatment so the divergence between the statuteеХs ban and the regulationsеХ could not have been authoritatively addressed.The remaing case sometimes cited (and discussed by the majority in Alexander v. Choate) is Guardians Association v. Civil Service Commission 463 U.S. 582 (1983).  But to find in Guardians a bare majority for the proposition that agencies may promulgate disparate-impact regulations under Title VI one must add the opinion by Justice White to Justice MarshallеХs dissent and to Justice StevensеХ dissent (joined by Justices Brennan and Blackmun).  Four members of the CourtеСBurger Rehnquist Powell and OеХConnorеСexplicitly rejected this view.  Furthermore Justice White actually voted to affirm the holding below denying the plaintiff compensatory damages and also thought that the statute itself reaches disparate impact so еТ[t]he question whether agency regulations under Title VI may forbid only disparate impact еЙ thus remains open.еУ  Lambert 34 Ga. L. Rev. at 1207; see also id. at 1203-25 (discussing why disparate-impact regulations are invalid under the CourtеХs precedents).In all events whatever tenuous authority these three decisions might have had was snapped by the Court's much more recent decision in Sandoval (and earlier by the CourtеХs City of Boerne decision).  Clearly there are at least five justices who view the validity of disparate-impact regulations promulgated under Title VI as very much an open question and indeed indicated rather clearly that the regulations rest on dubious authority.And even if in some future case the Supreme Court rules that federal agencies have authority to write disparate-impact regulations that would not mean that they should do so especially given the many bad consequences that the disparate-impact approach has had for civil-rights law.  Thus the administration ought to be reassessing the use of the disparate-impact approach in all areas not required by statute and that includes Executive Order 13166.Indeed the disparate-impact approach is especially untenable in the language area.  It equates the use of English with national-origin discrimination which is absurd.  Ability to speak English and ethnicity are obviously distinct qualities.  Some people of a particular national origin will not be able to speak English well but others will.  Conversely some people not of that particular national origin will also not be able to speak English well.  Thus the courts have overwhelmingly rejected claims that employers with a preference or even a requirement for speaking EnglishеСpractices that go much further than the mere failure to make the positive accommodations that the guidance would requireеСare discriminating on the basis of national origin.  (These cases are collected and discussed in Barnaby Zall English in the Workplace (2000) (published by the Center for Equal Opportunity).)The Supreme CourtеХs decision in Espinoza v. Farah Manufacturing Co. 414 U.S. 86 (1973) is also instructive.  It held there that it was not national origin discrimination when an employer refused to hire a noncitizen.  The CourtеСper Justice Marshall with Justice Douglas the only dissenterеСendorsed an early EEOC opinion that еТ`national originеХ refers to the country from which the individual or his forbears came еЙ not whether or not he is a United States citizenеУ (id. at 94).  The Court had noted еТCertainly the plain language of the statute supports [that] resultеУ (id. at 88) and that Title VIIеХs legislative history еТsuggest[ed] that the terms еФnational originеХ and еФancestryеХ were considered synonymousеУ (id. at 89).  WhatеХs more the Court expressly rejected the EEOCеХs attempt to ban discrimination against foreigners by arguing that it would have a disparate impact on the basis of national origin (id. at 92-95).  It would seem to follow that discrimination against all foreign languages doesnеХt violate the law; only discrimination against a language associated with a particular national origin.While it is of course possible that a particular Title VI recipient might choose not to make its programs available in a language other than English as a way of discriminating against a particular ethnic group it seems fair to assume that the overwhelming majority of Title VI recipients use only English not out of any illicit motive but simply because of ease convenience and thrift.  Thus it is much fairer for the government to limit itself to going after recipients it suspects of disparate treatmentеСespecially since that is all the underlying statute prohibits.  There is no reason to assume recipients who use only English are guilty until they can show their good faith and a business necessity for their policy.  Nor is there any reason to assume that unless the federal government is requiring recipients to make programs available in English that they will not do so.  Many recipients will indeed accommodate non-English-speakers; but the decision of whether and how to do so should be and is theirs to make not the federal governmentеХs. Worse the guidance endorses the notion that America ought to be a multilingual nation and removes important incentives for all Americans to learn English.  A common tongue becomes more not less important as our nation grows more multiracial and multiethnic.  We must be able to communicate with one another and it is very damaging if the federal government is sending the message that learning English is not necessary for being an American.  In short as dubious as Executive Order 13166 is as a matter of law it is much worse as a matter of policy.  Executive Order 13166 ought to be revoked.  Furthermore all agency regulations and guidance promulgated under Title VI that rely on the disparate-impact approach should be revoked as well.  ,DOT-OST-2001-8696,DOT Guidance To Recipients on Special Language Services to Limited English Proficient (LEP) Beneficiaries,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2001-8696-0004,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Center for Equal Opportunity,2006-01-05T00:00:00-05:00,Roger Clegg,Center for Equal Opportunity ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

F. R. Part 382Docket Number OST-2005-22298Any correspondence in relation to these comments should be sent to Danielle Chapman Thomsonfly Industry Affairs Wigmore House Wigmore PlaceWigmore LaneLutonLU2 9TNUKDanielle.chapman@uk.britanniaairways.comThomsonfly is writing in response to the NPRM in the Federal Register published on the 7th September 2005 on Non Discrimination on the basis of disability in Air Travel еР Medical Oxygen and portable respiration assistive devices having had an opportunity to read and analyse itеХs impact and effect on the operations and business of Thomsonfly. Thomsonfly a UK charter carrier and holder of a US Foreign Air Carrier permit welcomes the opportunity to comment on the proposals to require airlines to provide in flight medical oxygen.  Thomsonfly has long been committed to ensuring there is no discrimination in air travel and we have been a long term supporter and champion of the UK Voluntary Code of practice for Accessibility in Air Travel.  Thomsonfly also follows the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) recommendations in the field of facilitation as set out in Doc 30 part 1 section 5.Having had the chance to review and digest the NPRM Thomsonfly urges the Department to withdraw the proposed law as we believe the proposals are currently threatening flight safety will raise serious security concerns and will pose significant operational and financial concerns as well as being illegal on the ground of extra-territoriality. Extra-Territoriality Concerns1.Thomsonfly is a UK registered carrier and as such considers the UK as its administrative home.  As with our arguments on the extension of the Air Carrier Access Act to foreign carriers any requirement on the part of US authorities to require foreign air carriers to meet domestic legislation should be constructed as being an extra-territorial application of legislative prerogative.2.Thomsonfly recognises in certain situation that the current US legislation is effective extra-territoriality where the main aim is to protect US citizens abroad.  However as a UK registered carrier and regulated by the UK CAA or EU civil aviation institutions Thomsonfly does not sell eastbound originated seats to the UK and as a result the vast majority of ThomsonflyеХs passengers are UK originating making the requirements highly burdensome for Thomsonfly as well as being contrary to the accepted principles of sovereignty.3.Thomsonfly also believes the proposed rule will be inappropriate because of the imminent introduction of new European legislation and we agree with the comments of ECAC that the proposed rule is еФinappropriate because of the forthcoming introduction of European Law which will address the rights of disabled passengers and because of potential conflicts with national and European practices on safety and security.еХ4.Thomsonfly also notes that recently the Supreme Court ruled in the Spector et al v Norwegian Cruise lines Limited that domestic US legislation relating to the carriage of disabled passengers applied only where the policies procedures and facilities have an effect on US citizens and their rights.  As set out in paragraph 2 Thomsonfly carries mainly UK originating passengers and we would argue that ThomsonflyеХs non-compliance with the proposed rule would have no detrimental affect on any US citizen and as such Thomsonfly should not be subject to the requirements of the proposed rule.Safety Concerns5.Under requirement 382.133 placing the regulatory burden of testing respiratory assistive devices on the air carriers will provide a level of administration for the air carrier that is unreasonable.  Providing an up to date list of all the different respiratory devices for the number of different aircraft operated in an air carrierеХs fleet is impractical and time consuming.6.Thomsonfly also questions with the level of technological advancement how often these electrical devices will be updated and we believe it is only practicable that the manufactures of the respiratory devices should approach the aircraft manufactures to test and develop standards to certify these assistive devices.7.Thomsonfly would also be concerned about the effects poorly maintained or malfunction models could potentially have on our aircraft and we do not believe that a one time test is enough to certify the equipment safe and compatible with aircraft systems.8.The testing and certifying of the respiratory device by the aircraft manufacturer would save thousands of man hours and duplication of work around the commercial aviation industry as otherwise each individual carrier would have to test the same piece of equipments costing the industry an enormous amount.Security Concerns9.Thomsonfly is also concerned about the security aspects of the proposed rule.  Encouraging passengers to take on their own oxygen cylinders creates additional security risks.  It would be very difficult for staff on the day to determine that the cylinders are filled with oxygen and not other noxious gases or explosive devices.10.If the carrier is required the test the equipment and there is no standard of certified scheme for these devices to meet then it is impractical to expect check-in staff to be able to ensure еФon the dayеХ that the device has not been tampered with and that it is an approved oxygen system that indeed does contain oxygen. A scheme such as the defibrillator scheme where Boeing and Airbus carry out testing on the device and certify it for use onboard aircraft and at certain times of the flight should be pursued.Operational Issues11.Thomsonfly does not believe the respiratory devices should be used during take off and landing because of safety concerns.  Those people who are reliant on respiratory devices will need to be provided with airline supplied supplemental oxygen during these periods.12.Aircraft upgrades and downgrades.  If the aircraft type that the device has been tested and approved on has a technical problem and is swapped for a different aircraft type there is a risk that the device would potentially become an unsafe piece of equipment and the passengers would be delayed or denied boarding.  It would be wholly unsafe totally unreasonable and impractical for airlines to have to carry out last minute testing in these circumstances.13.Aircraft mains power is often at a different voltage and frequency from power on the ground and therefore maybe incompatible with the operational use of these devices.14.IATAеХs Dangerous Goods regulation conflicts with the DoTs requirement to require foreign carriers to carry respiratory devices or oxygen canisters.  The IATA Dangerous Goods regulation 1.2.4 states еТnothing contained in these regulations should be interpreted asеЙеЙ. requiring an operator to transport a particular article of substanceеУ.15.The IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations 2.3.4 also states еТthe following goods are permitted on aircraft as checked or carry on baggage with the approval of the operatorеЙ small gaseous or air cylinders required for medical use.еУ The UK Civil Air Authority Dangerous Goods Office has determined that small is determined to be up to 18 inches long. 16.Thomsonfly estimates that the content of an 18 inch cylinder (based on the cylinders we carry in the event of an onboard medical emergency) would last for approx 30 mins and that even for a short haul flight up to 4 cylinders would be needed.  This poses a problem as in a high density configured aircraft which is central to the survival of the charter airline business model operated by Thomsonfly; there is no space for storage of these cylinders within the cabin.17.Thomsonfly also notes that recently the Supreme Court ruled in the Spector et al v Norwegian Cruise lines Limited that the foreign flagged cruise ships would also be exempted from any requirement that would create serious difficulties for the vessel and would have a serious impact on its operations.  Thomsonfly would again ask that as a UK registered carrier and as the majority of passengers carried are UK originating citizens Thomsonfly should be exempted from the requirements of the rule.Summary18.Thomsonfly remains committed to ensuring the transport of disabled passengers but believes the proposed rule is unworkable unsafe and dangerous and place overly onerous requirements on the aviation industry.  Thomsonfly believes it should be withdrawn until the concerns highlighted above have been addressed and rectified in dialogue with the Aviation industry.,DOT-OST-2005-22298,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Medical Oxygen and Portable Respiration Assistive Devices,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2005-22298-0435,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Thomsonfly Industry Affairs,2006-01-30T00:00:00-05:00,Danielle Chapman,Thomsonfly ,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
154,DOT,FALSE,0,2006-04-24T23:59:59-04:00,NA,"Attn: Department of TransprotationMy experince of air travel for many years. I have retina pigmentosa and  Usher sydrome type one. We need more improvement access at airprots and concorses and maps etc. As follows in pro and cons. 1. The airport workers include escorters will need more training as sighted guide for the blind and deafblind by showing the handrails to the stairways escalators and moving walking ways. and etc. Also use basic signs at security check in and etc. This will heop avoid ride on wheelchairs and use elevators unless asked to do by deafblind or blind only. They kept asking me to ride on wheelchair many times and I refused because my doctor said walk for more excericse and minds as my body is strong balanced to walk not to ride on wheelchairs. 2. the signs of gate numbers and follow up signates must be full illiminated in white letters and numbers on black background to help retina pigmentosa see better with more light access. The signs include gate nubmers in teh hallways on concorse plus on top of door to the boarding ramps. The best airprot that have both hall and door to boarding ramps are avaible are Seattle on N concorse and in Chicago Ohare on concorse B and C only. The other airprots that have illimiated gate numbers signs in hallways only are in Denver  Baltimroe Memphis and other few airports. Many airports use painted signs or aluiminum steel signs as some lights are directly to signs and many are not that low vision is unable to find and gets lost any wheere or boarding wrong planes etc. Best recommended that airport will have to upgrade it to improve the walkway directions smoothly with new illiminated signs etc. The red illimated signs must be changed to yellow to make more easy to read like information of flgihts number and designation city etc. In Seattle at baggage claim area is the best signs displayed in yellow fonts on black background showing airline name and flight nubmer also laarge white numbers showing bagage claim areas. I wish other airport to do follow suite to improve it. At Washington Dulles the signs are terrible in poor vision as i was in concorese C and D all are in aluminis or steel fonts that are not ehlping pwoeple with retiis pigmentosa but only one gate ""D20"" has illiminated signs with white fonts on black background. I wish they update some times now. 3. Food for purchase on board passengers with low vison unable to read magazine to pick the menu of thir choices. we want to get large print and braille to be made out by airport kitchens to the aircraft of avaible selections to help deaf and deafblind access on reading. Request must be made with reservation dept to contact airprot kitchens within 24 hours prior to departure. Only two times in my life there was a steward knows sign langauge that helped me communiate each other and pick the menu and other inforamtion. Written notes is ok but the hand written is harder for anyone to read it unless they print it clearly. I wish more steward and stewardness who knows sign langage will be board to work with deaf adn deafblind passengers more comfortable in communications. 4. airprot escorts: only two times they knows sign language I met them for assistance was in Chciago Ohare and Orlando. Others few knows fingerspelling and can do palm writtings. 5. Travel organizer with pendant displayes id card inforamtion that person is deaf and visual impared or deafblind tickets  boarding passes also on back of card will show information of communication methods they choice to communicate with me either sign langage or tactile  fingerspelling  palm writing or write notes with passenger's favoirtie pens etc. I hope the changes will improve everybody more access sooner however due to rising fuel and oil prices that hurts airlines and airporets with finanices that are unable to pay to make any improvemnts unless the goverment issue winfall profit tax against oil companies that will use money to rebate the airlines who over paid the fuel prices. Or there will be anti trust law and the court will fine oil companies and oil exports touse money to rebate other companies who were hurt with finainces. Any comments or questions please advise me by email. I am in board of directors (national) of American Assoication of Deafblind. Thank you for your time to read my feedbacks and I hope you can take time to do research and make more improvements in future.

Our services not only fill the gaps at the local community level but we also act as feeders to the Metro and Municipal transit services.  West Hollywood is a small community of only 1.9 square miles within the Los Angeles County metropolis with approximately 35000 residents.  However the City spends over $2 million per year in providing transportation programs providing nearly 80000 trips annually.  Funding these programs becomes more challenging each year.  The majority of the trips are provided to the most transit dependent elderly and disabled members of our community.  Our existing services currently accommodate special services to meet their needs in door to door services.Our submittal of comments regarding proposed rule changes for CFR Parts 27 37 and 38 еТTransportation for Individuals with DisabilitiesеУ reflects the concerns of West Hollywood as well as concerns from a diverse group of operators providing fixed route and dial-a-ride services.  Although West Hollywood understands the desire to provide better service to customers with disabilities as a small Local City with limited funding we must balance that with the realities of limited fiscal and human resources to accomplish new mandates.  Specifically we must object to:27.7Discrimination prohibitedThe concept of еТreasonable modificationеУ as presented in the proposed rules is arbitrary and capricious.  What is considered еТreasonable by one person may be unreasonable to another person.  What constitutes reasonable modifications is not defined meaning actual definitions will be provided through litigation.  FTA accepted service plans will be replaced by unpredictable policy changes resulting in higher costs and reduced service levels.   It should be noted that the provision of complimentary paratransit under the regulations that are currently in place are considered the reasonable modification to fixed-route transit services.37.129Origin to destinationAllowing passengers to decide the service level necessary for their trip exposes operators to litigation and less productive service.  For fixed-route operators bus stops have been sited for safety with spacing being a balance between passenger convenience and speed of the trip.  If a passenger has the right to demand pickup between any stop safety is compromised as the driver must  constantly watch the sidewalk for flag stops as well as the traffic in front of the bus.  These flag stops may be at unsafe locations since a driverеХs job description may not include the training and authority to determine for a transit authority where a safe stop is.  For paratransit the requirement to provide door-to-door service would require the driver to leave his vehicle unattended.  On shared trips this may require the operator to employ a personal care attendant as an immediate responder to the needs of any passengers still in the vehicle.  The transit providerеХs other option would be to eliminate shared rides incurring significant additional costs.37.3Direct threatDefining direct threat to refer only to people other than the passenger does not take into account medical or psychological conditions that may cause that passenger to be a threat to their own health.  The free fare for personal care attendants (PCA) is an accommodation to this reality.  Prohibiting operators from defining direct threat to include the passenger could force operators to provide PCAs for some passengers at additional cost or place our passengers at unacceptable risk. 37.15Interpretations and GuidanceNo imperative reason has been presented for codifying a еТDisability Law Coordinating Council.еУ  The ability of this Council to issue binding rulings without the consent or acknowledgement of the Secretary of Transportation is most troubling for its lack of accountability.  As a local operator West Hollywood is currently able to provide a variety of service levels to our riders commensurate with our funding and local needs.  Requiring all operators to provide service under the conditions of the proposed regulation changes will result in significant litigation and a reduction in service levels due to increased costs.Thank you for your consideration.SincerelyJoyce L.

156,DOT,FALSE,0,2006-04-28T23:59:59-04:00,NA,The Americans with Disabilities Act aims to end official discrimination toward people with disabilities.  ADA Title III requires that public facilities be made equally accessible for people with disabilities as they are for people without disabilities unless a modification would impose an undue burden.  Melton v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit (2004) was a setback for our society as the 5th Circuit Court decided to ignore the spirit of the ADA in favor of adopting a very technical reading of the DOT Codes.  By deciding that a modification in practice was not required to help a rider overcome a physical barrier to boarding a DART vehicle the 5th Circuit court essentially ruled that people with disabilities don?t have a right to equal access to public transportation.  If amending 49 CFR 37.5 will clarify that public entities providing public transportation must make reasonable modifications to avoid discrimination and provide accessibility to people with disabilities I support the change.  Revising Section 37.169 is a good idea but there are no teeth to the current form of oversight.  DOT can review the entity?s determination not to make a modification because it creates an undue burden but just as in DOJ cases of alleged discrimination or noncompliance with the ADA the reality is that filing a claim is unlikely to result in any real action.  I?ve observed that a person with a disability often tries several times to notify the allegedly noncompliant entity of access issues files a claim with DOJ or DOT waits for months or years for change and eventually either gives up or files a lawsuit against the entity.  There should be a more widely publicized process for passengers to raise compliance and discrimination issues and certainly a more strongly enforced review process.  I applaud the Department for trying to make providers understand that the ADA language applies to transit providers funded by FTA but there doesn?t appear to be enough oversight to make sure the providers meet a standard of service in providing service to people with disabilities.  The proposed revisions to 49 CFR 37.5 and 37.169 and the clarification of 37.23 for public entities? arrangements or relationships with private entities are a step in the right direction.I support the standardized method for counting trip denials/missed trips for paratranist providers (Item 7).  This approach recognizes that denial of one trip may preclude the ability to use the return trip.  The consistent use of this method will allow providers and the FTA to compare transit systems in a more meaningful way.Item 6 opens up the issue of new mobility devices which may not fit the Department?s existing definition of a ?common wheelchair? may be too large or heavy for current vehicle capacity requirements or may raise safety issues for other passengers.  I think the Disability Law Coordinating Council should create a subcommittee for the companies which create the mobility devices and the companies which create the accessible vehicles to communicate and decide upon mutually compatible solutions.  Perhaps there could be some incentive built in for the cooperating companies such as free publicity to encourage entities to buy the vehicles and to encourage individuals to buy the mobility devices.,DOT-OST-2006-23985,Transportation for Individuals With Disabilities,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2006-23985-0046,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2006-04-28T00:00:00-04:00,Elaine Chen,Elaine Chen  ,2105-AD54,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
157,DOT,FALSE,0,2006-04-28T23:59:59-04:00,NA, April 28 2006Draft ADA Rulemaking CommentsDocket Management FacilityUnited States Department of Transportation400 Seventh Street SWNassif Building  PL-401Washington D.C.  20590-0001                                         Docket OST-2006-23985Dear Docket Clerk:These comments are provided to the Docket on behalf of the Central Contra Costa Transit Authority (CCCTA). CCCTA operates 131 fully accessible fixed route buses and 51 paratransit vans in a largely suburban area just east Oakland California. Our services area is over 200 square miles and we have a population of over 500000.  Our draft FY07 operating budget for CCCTA is just under $30 million. Of that $4.6 million is budgeted for ADA paratransit or about 15.3% of our total projected expenditures. In the month of February 2007 we had 1189 individual users of ADA paratransit service. We typical certify up to 100 or more ADA paratransit users each month. We have taken great steps to encourage the use of fixed route services among would be ADA paratransit users by providing travel training working with health care providers and other providers of services to the disabled and by offering free fares on fixed route service for eligible users between the hours of10:00 am and 2:00 pm. We have taken great pains to ensure that we do not deny service on our ADA paratransit service. And on many occasions we have in effect practiced reasonable modifications in our delivery of services to the disabled on both fixed route and paratransit services. We are very proud of our record of ADA compliance and the provision of related services at CCCTA over the past 15 years.  CCCTA has very strong concerns with the proposed amendments to 49 CFR parts 27 37 and 38.  While the proposed amendments seem well intentioned it is our strong belief that these proposals will serve to substantially reduce the reliability and predictability of accessible transportation substantially increase the costs of accessible services and ultimately result in significantly less accessible public transit for both our disabled and other transit riders.  Our specific comments follow.49 CFR Parts 27.7 37.5 and 37.169While the preamble discussion to this proposed amendment is extensive and focuses on the provision of passenger assistance beyond the curb the actual language of the proposed amendment is overwhelmingly general and will impose far more extensive obligations on transit operators and operations than the preamble indicates.  The proposed requirement would require reasonable modification in any and all aspects of public transportation services where an individual makes a claim that they need such modification to effectively make use services.  The major problem with this proposed requirement beyond the extensive costs that it would impose is the introduction of a number of variables in to the delivery of service that will reduce the reliability and predictability of our transit services.  It is important to realize that in order to deliver a quality and consistent service it is necessary to have well defined procedures that our drivers have been trained to proficiency in.  (In fact the current regulations require our operators to be trained to proficiency on issues that affect accessibility). Anytime we increase the complexity and the variability of the delivery of service (by requiring customized passenger responses as the NPRM proposes) we increase the opportunity for our staffsеХ to make mistakes and judgments which can and will result in service failures and a loss of reliability.  Numerous research studies show that increasing the decisions that operators dispatchers and reservations agents have to make on daily basis will serve to substantially reduce the reliability of our services.  When we have surveyed our passengers with disabilities their number one priority over convenience comfort speed and directness is the reliability and consistency of their service. The NPRM also indicates that these proposed modifications to the DOT regulations do not represent significant departures from existing regulations and policy and not expected to have noteworthy cost impacts on regulated parties.  This statement reflects a complete lack of understanding of the impacts and the magnitude of the change that is proposed.  The proposed regulations would require the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the regulated transit providers to document each individual decision to deny a requested modification on the basis that the requested modification creates an undue burden or fundamental alteration of the primary service.  This requirement by itself is highly burdensome.  At CCCTA we receive a large number of requests for modification daily. From information from our operators and dispatchers we estimate that we receive more than 20 requests per day.  This equates modification requests on about 3% of our daily paratransit trips and something less than 0.25% of fixed route trips.  If we are required to document by the CEO each time we deny a modification request on the basis it violates operating policy or is unsafe we will have to add additional staff at a cost of nearly $80000 per year.    Probably the best way to illuminate these potential impacts is to describe a number of actual service modification requests that we have dealt with over the last year within our relatively small system. Illustrative Examples: Fixed RouteStop Locations:  The NPRM discusses the concept that picking up a person at other than a defined stop location could be reasonable accommodation.  And while on its surface this does seem reasonable experience has shown that it is fraught with serious safety and reliability issues.  Our system has a number of rural routes that have very rural segments where no sidewalks or walking pathways exist. Safety issues will increases dramatically if we are required to stop a bus anywhere along these types of routes without regard to safety. Many of routes are along highly developed suburban type roadways with high speed limits. Many adjacent areas are simply too dangerous to allow any passengers on or off the bus at that given point. Moreover we are now paying even more attention to bus stop safety in response to a State of California Supreme Court Decision Bonanno v. CCCTA where were found at fault and responsible for a victim that was hit by a car while reportedly going to one of our bus stops. The bus stop in questions was placed at an intersection with a cross walk. The victim was in the crosswalk when hit by a car. But the Court found that CCCTA should have known that crossing the road in that crosswalk to get to our bus stop was a dangerous situation and we should have removed the bus stop and not allowed anyone to board or get off a bus at the location of the bus stop. Additionally CCCTA receives complaints that someone was passed at up at a bus stop. In most cases the bus operator states that did not see the person in question. These situations will only increase under the proposed rule as bus operators will not always recognize would be disabled passengers away from the bus stops. If we have passengers being missed on an occasional basis where operators expect passengers one can see that it is highly likely that transit operators will pass up disabled passengers who are attempting to utilize the services from unconventional locations.  CCCTA bus operators cannot be expected to determine the intentions of individuals standing along the side of the road away from bus stops or stop at any location the passengersеХ request.  If we are required to stop at other than defined stops to accommodate disabled persons it will create conflict on the bus between drivers and passengers and will cause numerous disabled passengers to be passed by unintentionally.  This potential will also cause increased radio and dispatch time as operators request clarifications and authority.  The NPRM proposal will require our operators to make еТoff the cuffеУ significant safety and civil rights decisions.  It is bad public policy to put our operators and passengers in this unfair situation.  Alternative Fare Media:  Periodically we receive requests to provide alternative fare media for disabled riders.  Currently we accept coins paper bills tokens and passes.  We receive fairly regular requests for paper ticket because tokens and coins are difficult for person with certain disabilities to handle.  We have denied the request because we do not want to complicate our fare media and the cost of processing paper tickets is substantially higher than that of tokens.  If we were required to provide alternative fare media it would increase our costs by $25000 per year (printing security and staff time).    Tie-Down Locations/Orientation:  Several of our older fixed route buses have rear door lifts with one forward and one rear facing tie-down location.  Due to the orientation of the lift and the ambulatory seating it is impossible to put someone in the rear facing location if someone is riding in the forward facing tie-down location.  Further if someone is in the forward facing location the ambulatory passenger aisle is effectively blocked.  Because of this less than ideal arrangement it is practice that wheelchair users be loaded into the rear facing location unless it is already occupied. Several individuals have requested that we only transport them in the forward facing location because they allege that their disabilities are better accommodated forward facing.  While operators will usually honor this request (particularly on our long distance routes where we have very few wheelchair users) on routes with numerous wheelchair users the operator will usually decline so that they can effectively serve all of our passengers. If we were required to provide reasonable modification we would be faced with a situation where we would have to unload one passenger to board the second passenger and then set up a potential conflict between the passengers or have to send a second vehicle so both passengers can travel forward facing.  This is another situation that will increase dispatch and radio time as well as creating on vehicle conflicts and its affiliated costs.   Paratransit Service:Door to Door Service:  CCCTA provides curb-to-curb ADA paratransit and for a few riders that need it reasonable modifications that resemble door-to-door and go beyond the current ADA regulations. This means that our operators will provide boarding and alighting assistance to riders from the paratransit vehicles to the door of the origin and destinations as long as the door is within the line of sight of the paratransit vehicle and that the driver can maintain control of the vehicle when this is needed to provide service to an individual. The drivers are also instructed to not go through any door (although they can open public doors and announce their presence) and they are not permitted to lift a person or attempt to navigate steps with a passengers wheeled devices.  This service is limited to locations where the operator can safely park a vehicle avoid overhanging obstructions and avoid backing the vehicle up.  In addition we will not serve locations where the pathway to the door has not clear or where the operator has to have a security gate opened.  Additionally we will not provide door to door service to individuals who do not have a phone or access to a phone where we can reach them to let them know that we could not find a safe parking location within the sight of their origin.  Most of service is curb-to-curb without modification. The proposed rule will have the effect of making our entire system door-to-door. It is our strong belief that by introducing variables in the required services (by requiring reasonable modification as proposed) will reduce the reliability of service to point that systemsеХ will have to add back-up vehicles and systems at significant cost to ensure ADA compliant levels of service.  Each additional vehicle we add to our service costs us $170000 (about 3.7% of paratransit budget) annually.Exclusive Trips:  Many passengers on a daily basis make requests for exclusive trips on the basis of need related to their disability.  We have had individuals state that they need exclusive trips because they have phobias that make it impossible to ride with others or that they are so claustrophobic that they can not tolerate being in the vehicle for any length of time and therefore need a faster exclusive ride.  An extreme case we had was with a mentally disabled child who attacked other passengers.  The care giver asked us to provide an exclusive ride accommodation because they maintained that the child was only violent in the presence of other individuals and so if they had exclusive rides they could effectively benefit from the service.  Currently as the accommodation of an exclusive ride is rarely provided in our system most riders do not request it.  Even so our reservations staff reports that they receive this request from different individuals at least twice a week.  If we were to grant this accommodation 100 times a year and the requester rides and average of 24 times per month (12 round trips) we would reduce our system wide productivity by nearly 5%%.  This loss of productivity would cost us approximately $200000 (or about 4.3% of our paratransit budget) a year.   Reduced Scheduling Window:  A more common request for a еТdisabilityеУ related accommodation is where an individual claims that they need an exclusive ride because they have a schedule that can not accommodate a shared ride and that schedule is necessitated by their disability.  For example individuals have requested exclusive trips where they report that they have a personal care aide who can arrive no earlier than 7:00 am to assist them and that they require 1 hour to be ready for a pick-up. They also have an appointment with a specialist that they could only get at 9:00 am and the minimum ride time from their home to the specialist is 30 minutes.  Accordingly they request the accommodation of a reduced scheduling window so that the pick-up be between 8:00 am and 8:20 am (rather than the regulatory required 7:00 am to 9:00 am negotiation window) in order to accommodate the schedule of the aide.  Further they will usually also request an exclusive ride so that they can make their appointment on time.  This request is highly common.  Our staff reports that they have this kind of request nearly every day.  The cost of accommodating this type of request would be extreme.  Our estimate is that it would cost us over $400000 (8.9%of paratransit budget) per year to reduce scheduling windows and speed up travel by reducing shared rides.  Private Streets - Trailer Parks/Large Apartment Blocks:  Many of our riders live in trailer parks or large apartment blocks. Commonly they will live at a significant distance from the public street and will therefore request their paratransit pick-up in front of their trailer or apartment because of mobility limitations.  In some cases this is not much of an issue because the private street serving the park or complex is large enough to accommodate our vehicles.  But even where the private streets are large enough we have issues with parked cars over grow vegetation and other impediments.  Because the streets are private we can not call the police to ticket or tow an obstructing vehicle and we have no assurance that trees and other vegetation is cleared to a height or that awnings overhangs and other impediments will permit our vehicles to access the rider.  The situation becomes even more of a problem where the access street is narrow and or unpaved.  In these circumstances some of our vehicles may be able to access the ridersеХ trailer or apartment but usually not all of our fleet.  This creates a huge scheduling complication where we then need to assign a particular sized vehicle to a particular passenger.  Anytime we are required to assign a particular vehicle to a specific passenger we reduce the systems productivity (passengers per hour) and therefore increase costs. This impact is very significant.  In  our system where we have chosen to go beyond the ADA requirements and provide access to many private drives enter into apartment complexеХs and trailer parks this decision has increased our daily vehicle needs by 10 to 15% or approximately $300000 (6.5% of paratransit budget) annually.  Additionally we have between 2 and 5 accidents every year where we strike an overhang awning or tree where we cause several thousand dollars in damage.  Oversized Wheelchairs: Currently we do not handle oversized wheelchairs. To do so would require a significant retrofit of our fully ADA compliant fleet. These costs would be tremendous at $70000 per paratransit vehicle and at $300000 per transit bus.  No Show Forgiveness:  Regularly we receive requests for accommodations from individuals who are facing suspensions for no-shows.  These requests ask that we forgive a no-show because it was earned due to a symptom of a disability.  For example an individual will claim that they no-showed because they needed to unexpectedly use a restroom and this need was disability related.  Or an individual with diabetes will claim that they felt their blood sugar falling and needed to seek food and were unable to make their bus.  Some blind individuals have claimed that they no-showed because they were waiting at the wrong location and did not realize this because of their blindness.  Probably the most significant number of no-show related accommodation requests we receive are from individuals with mental disabilities. Many of these individuals will claim that their no-shows are caused by their disabilities which cause them confusion forgetfulness or other orientation related symptoms which causes the no-shows.  As they claim this is a feature of their disability they request that we not sanction them.  If we had to provide this accommodation we would see our no-show rate increase.  Based on our history when we were not actively enforcing our no-shows we know that absent enforcement we will have about a 4% no-show rate up from our current 0.5%. Assuming that our no-show rate on grows to 4% it would cost us well over $500000 per year to provide this accommodation. The overarching point of these illustrative examples is to demonstrate that the NPRM vastly underestimates the volume and variety of reasonable modification requests that transit systems will have to review and accommodate.  It also demonstrates that the cost impacts of accommodating these reasonable modification requests will be extreme and clearly meets the federal standard of being еТsignificantеУ.Direct ThreatThe department is proposing to change the definition of direct threat though this NPRM. The proposal states that direct threat only exists if there is a situation that is a threat to the health or safety of others rather than the current language which states that the threat could be to the disabled individual and or others.  While we agree with the stated reasons for the change (to insure that disabled individuals are not excluded on a subjective basis) our concern is that there are rare but legitimate reasons to exclude a person from our services on the basis of a threat to themselves.  The best example I can give is that of an individual with advanced age related dementia or AlzheimerеХs.  We have had cases where we have transported such an individual to their destination and once we have dropped the individual off the individual has wandered away (didnеХt enter or turned around and walked away from their destination) and because the individual was not reasonably competent the police were called and a search initiated.  Where we have had repeated occurrences of this behavior we have denied such individuals the right to travel unescorted on the basis that they demonstrated that they were a direct threat to themselves.  We understand that the ADA regulations do not require us to insure the еТsafe custodialеУ delivery of riders.  However we are bound by state laws which require us to maintain an acceptable level of customer care.  Accordingly we must ensure that a passenger that has demonstrated a propensity to put themselves into harms way is not facilitated by our actions.  If we are not permitted use the direct threat authority we currently possess we would have to provide custodial care for these types of passengers.  The costs of this accommodation will vary but could easily cost us more than $70000 per year (the cost of one additional paratransit vehicle).   Disability Law Coordinating Council:The NPRM proposes to codify an existing internal administrative mechanism.  We do not understand why an internal administrative decision is an appropriate discussion for an NPRM unless the DLCC is intended for a more significant purpose than simply coordinating the various DOT administrationsеХ interpretations of disability law.  We believe that there is a perfectly reasonable purpose for an internal coordinating group however it imperative that this group not be allowed to function as de facto rule-making entity.  We strongly believe that anytime that the department is contemplating clarifications and or expanded interpretations of their regulations; they need to use a formal notice and comment process in order to gain insight on the proposal and potential unintended consequences of the departmentеХs proposals.Regulatory and AnalysisThe regulatory analysis and notices section of the NPRM certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on substantial number of small entities.  This is an utterly absurd statement.  The comment in the regulation is that the number of small transit systems that provide fixed route service is not expected to be large.  In Washington State the last series of grant awards of federal rural funding went to 60 different recipients.  Of these recipients better than 2/3 of the grantees operate some fixed route service.  This pattern is duplicated across the U.S.  In addition the NPRM states that the impact will not be significant because transit systems can choose to operate route deviated service in lieu of fixed route.  This statement is equally absurd because the language of the regulation specifically covers all services including route deviated services.  The notice also states that the will be no impact because the regulation includes an undue burden waiver provision at 37.151 - 37.155.  This statement is probably the most absurd of these series of statements because the FTA has not provided any mechanism to have an undue burden request approved.  In fact it is the policy of the FTA to only grant temporary time extensions of the requirements.  Further the FTA has stated in writing that these temporary time extensions must demonstrate that the entity will come into compliance within a set period of time.  This clearly indicates that regulated entities will have to incur the expenses thereby causing a significant impact on small entities.Summary:If we were too simply to accommodate these current modification requests we would have to increase our paratransit budget roughly $1.5 to $2 million per year an increase of 30 to 45 percent!   This would increase our current spending on ADA paratransit from 15.3% % of our total spending to 22%.  This increase would require us to eliminate approximately 15% of our highly disabled passenger utilized accessible fixed route bus service.  In our system this would probably require us to eliminate weekend service and because of the compounding impacts of the loss of riders we would have to continue to reduce service in out years due to the loss of fares and passenger generated incentive funding.  Further these cost estimates do not include the administrative and legal costs of documenting the requests and if we deny the request the cost of defending our decisions.  If our experience where we provide extensive door to door service would require us to increase ADA paratransit service by 30% is shared by the rest of transit systems in this country then we would see the national costs of paratransit increase from its current $1.8 billion (recent NTD data) to $2.7 billion.  Clearly this increase in costs would be significant and the proposed rulemaking should be evaluated under Executive Order 12866 and subjected to a rigorous economic analysis.Further we question the basic need for the proposed revision to regulations.  Since the regulations were first adopted in 1991 the transit industry has aggressively worked to comply and meet our obligations to customers with disabilities.  Industry wide since these regulations went into effect we have provided well over 1 billion ADA paratransit trips.  The vast vast majority of these trips were provided effectively timely and met the access needs of the riders.  Over the same period the FTA has received somewhere around 5000 complaints (based on verbal reports from the FTA Office of Civil Rights) on ADA services.  Of these roughly 5000 complaints the vast majority were determined to not be violations of the rules.  It seems that the department is seeking to unnecessarily upset what has been by any fair evaluation one of the great successes accessibility law and regulation.

The Greater Bridgeport Transit Authority (GBTA) is a transit agency in Connecticut providing ADA and DAR transportation to clients throughout Bridgeport Fairfield Stratford and Trumbull.  As is true with most transit agencies GBTA has realized a significant increase in Paratransit ridership without comparable increases in funding.  Due to financial constraints it has been extremely challenging to continue the level of support GBTA has always provided.  GBTA has within reason provided door-to-door service.  However to expand this definition may leave GBTAеХs clients property and services in jeopardy.  In working with our Passenger Advisory Committee some social service agencies were concerned about leaving clients especially those cognitively challenged unattended to provide assistance to another client.  To expand the definition of this service would require GBTA to always have a company provided escort on board adding costs to a budget already with deficits. GBTA takes exception to the statement that the proposed changes do not represent significant changes from existing policy and that there would be minimal or no associated cost impacts.  Many of the proposed changes could have a significant increase in cost and could result in a reduction of both fixed route and paratransit service. In other words many disabled individuals to which the ADA is designed to assist would loose transportation options. Most local transit agencies are already struggling with the increased demand for Paratransit services.  The proposed language would require еТreasonable modifications/accommodationsеУ which constitutes vague and in many cases indefinable text.  What we consider reasonable or unreasonable may in another community not be an issue.  GBTA has grave concerns as we are in the Northeast with heavy snow storms.  Imposing a requirement to provide еТdoor-to-doorеУ service in an area not shoveled would increase the possibility of workers compensation claims and the safety of our employees subcontracted employees and clients.  GBTA has always worked hand-in-hand with the Kennedy Center to insure that our eligibility process and service is supportive of the disability communities needs.  The proposed text in our opinion would require GBTA to provide service above and beyond the scope of ADA Paratransit service.GBTA is concerned about the vagueness of the proposed language and the burden it places on individual agencies.  The retroactive required corrections to interpretations found to be unacceptable during audits could in many instances result in a reduction in service.  Transit agencies are often required to interpret language which in after thought during triennial reviews or other audits are determined to be unacceptable.  Cases in point are:ебInfeasibility or undue burdenебReview of appeal process for those trips which we believe can not be accommodatedебWhat is acceptable proof that a person with a disability requires enhanced serviceебDefinition of a fixed route bus stop variationебDefinition of a reasonable accommodationебDefinition of a direct threatGBTA is also concerned as to the expansion of the definition of a common wheelchair.  As the еТscooterеУ industry expands these mobility devices are becoming larger and heavier many times exceeding the approved weight limits of our lifts.  We can not discriminate against operators stating that they are unable to work for us simply because they can not еТsafelyеУ assist a client in a mobility device due to size and weight.  Many of our operators are small in statue and to require them to assist clients up and or down stairs in mobility devices could jeopardize the safety of both our employees and clients.The consideration of temporary circumstances and local conditions of streets cross walks sidewalks curt cuts etc. is one which GBTA would have great difficulty complying with as we are not staffed to conduct and maintain such information which as we all know changes on a daily basis.In summary GBTA understands the challenges that our clients face on a daily basis and the value our services provides to them their families and the community.  To increase our liability without funding these requirements may result in a reduction in service which would be of benefit to no one.SincerelyRon KilcoyneCEO       ,DOT-OST-2006-23985,Transportation for Individuals With Disabilities,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2006-23985-0045,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2006-04-28T00:00:00-04:00,Ron Kilcoyne,Ron Kilcoyne ,2105-AD54,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In Los Angeles County over 40 Local Cities provide fixed route services and 80 Cities provide paratransit services.  The Local Cities and the County operators are partners with the LAC Metro in the effort to provide transit services to Los Angeles County constituents.  Our services not only fill the gaps at the local community levels but we also act as feeders to the Metro and Municipal transit services.  The Local Cities and Los Angeles County services provide over 4 million trips on the paratransit services and over 10 million trips on the fixed route services to the region.  The majority of the trips are provided to the most transit dependent elderly and disabled members of our community.  The Local CitiesеХ existing services currently accommodate special services to meet their needs and we estimate that over 70% of the trips provided are for door to door services.Our submittal of comments regarding proposed rule changes for CFR Parts 27 37 and 38 еТTransportation for Individuals with DisabilitiesеУ is from a diverse group of operators providing fixed route and dial-a-ride services.  Although we understand the desire to provide better service to customers with disabilities as operators we must balance that with the realities of limited fiscal and human resources to accomplish new mandates.  Specifically we must object to:27.7Discrimination prohibitedThe concept of еТreasonable modificationеУ as presented in the proposed rules is arbitrary and capricious.  What is considered еТreasonable by one person may be unreasonable to another person.  What constitutes reasonable modifications is not defined meaning actual definitions will be provided through litigation.  FTA accepted service plans will be replaced by unpredictable policy changes resulting in higher costs and reduced service levels.   It should be noted that the provision of complimentary paratransit under the regulations that are currently in place are considered the reasonable modification to fixed-route transit services.37.129Origin to destinationAllowing passengers to decide the service level necessary for their trip exposes operators to litigation and less productive service.  For fixed-route operators bus stops have been sited for safety with spacing being a balance between passenger convenience and speed of the trip.  If a passenger has the right to demand pickup between any stop safety is compromised as the driver must  constantly watch the sidewalk for flag stops as well as the traffic in front of the bus.  These flag stops may be at unsafe locations since a driverеХs job description may not include the training and authority to determine for a transit authority where a safe stop is.  For paratransit the requirement to provide door-to-door service would require the driver to leave his vehicle unattended.  On shared trips this may require the operator to employ a personal care attendant as an immediate responder to the needs of any passengers still in the vehicle.  The transit providerеХs other option would be to eliminate shared rides incurring significant additional costs.37.3Direct threatDefining direct threat to refer only to people other than the passenger does not take into account medical or psychological conditions that may cause that passenger to be a threat to their own health.  The free fare for personal care attendants (PCA) is an accommodation to this reality.  Prohibiting operators from defining direct threat to include the passenger could force operators to provide PCAs for some passengers at additional cost or place our passengers at unacceptable risk. 37.15Interpretations and GuidanceNo imperative reason has been presented for codifying a еТDisability Law Coordinating Council.еУ  The ability of this Council to issue binding rulings without the consent or acknowledgement of the Secretary of Transportation is most troubling for its lack of accountability.  As local operators we are currently able to provide a variety of service levels to our riders commensurate with our funding and local needs.  Requiring all operators to provide service under the conditions of the proposed regulation changes will result in significant litigation and a reduction in service levels due to increased costs.Thank you for your consideration.SincerelyJoyce L.

160,DOT,FALSE,0,2006-04-28T23:59:59-04:00,NA,Overall if the original intent of ADA was to 'level the playing field' and offer equal opportunitied for people with disabilities to use mainline transit these proposed changes go far beyond.  Equality is not special treatment to the extent that its impracticality or expense significantly impairs the very transportation systems that are operating satisfactorily for others including many people with disabilities.  Transit and paratransit systems are revenue-driven and if mandated changes are too expensive or onerous to other passengers the  result is loss of business  loss of revenue and  decreased service or service quality. The original ADA paratransit regulations imperfect as they are did recognize the wide variety of conditions under which public transit and paratransit are provided and the wisdom of leaving many of the operational decisions to the local level with the situational knowledge.  It is ironic that the regulations have been in place and unchanged by DOT until now and these proposed DOT changes show little awareness of the potential operational impacts.   They sound reasonable - until one understands the daily workings and events of public transportation. I'll just comment on the paratransit proposals:- door-to-door service.  We have always operated door-to-door and I believe that with our clientele and weather that is the best structure for here.  The confusion over who receives door to door service and when is real and a nightmare where it occurs; additionally all of our customers have disabilities and many have highly variable health.  The need for door to door can change daily.  Simpler is better and door to door works here.  Both ATC and MV handle the safety concerns of drivers out of sight of the vehicles well.  The $20000 (or used to be that amount) additional insurance premium for door to door service is quickly offset by the cost of a couple of searches for lost customers and resulting lawsuits. - special acommodations.  Again local discretion is best to decide which accommodations are reasonable affordable and feasible without documention by the CEO ( or executive director) of each time a modification request was denied because it is unsafe or counter to operating policy.  ADA paratransit is (or was) intended to be the shared-ride equivalent of transit where many more rides are shared.  We do not have rear-facing wheelchair positions so are spared that discussion.  However we do receive requests for use of certain vehicle types  forward seats or wheelchair positions and for exclusive rides.   The requests are accommodated where feasible - except for exclusive rides which are not accommodated.  We have once or twice in the distant past sent individual vehicles for a rider but this was short-lived and only until appropriate attendant carre was implemented.     The common thread through all of these provisions for accommodations is that they are best left to the people advocates and local systems to decide and design rather than mandating national compliance with regulatatory verbage that may be well intentioned but is not well thought out.  It is difficult enough to meet ADA requirements now with their financial burdens and still provide good public transportation for the public.  Just as the RTC has to reduce other service to meet ADA trip requirements complying with these individual accommodation requests can have the effect of worsening transportation for many others thus tipping the playing field in the other direction and putting them at a disadvantage.,DOT-OST-2006-23985,Transportation for Individuals With Disabilities,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2006-23985-0057,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2006-04-28T00:00:00-04:00,David Jickling,David F.

WCCTA operates 41 fully accessible fixed route buses and 13 paratransit vans in a largely suburban area just north of Oakland California.  Our service area is approximately 37 square miles and we have a population of 65000.  Our adopted FY06-07 operating budget for WCCTA is $7.8 Million.  Of this $1.3 Million (approximately 17%) is budgeted for paratransit services including those required under the ADA.  We have taken great pains to ensure we have no denials of service on our ADA paratransit system and on many occasions we have in effect practiced reasonable modifications in our delivery of services to our ADA eligible passengers on both our fixed route and paratransit systems.  We are very proud of our record of ADA compliance and the provision of related services at WCCTA over the past 15 years.WCCTA has very strong concerns with the proposed amendments to 49 CFR parts 27 37 and 38.  While we support the concept of full accessibility of public transit and now provide services beyond those required under the ADA to persons with disabilities we disagree with both the proposed approach and with the specific details of the regulatory changes contained in the referenced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking еТNPRMеУ.  We strongly disagree with the representations in the NPRM that the proposed changes are simply a clarification of existing law and that the proposal does not represent a significant departure from existing regulations and policy and does not have еТnoteworthy cost impactsеУ.  In fact we believe the proposed regulatory changes exceed the scope of the powers delegated to the Department of Transportation in the ADA statute and are in conflict with the both the legislative intent of the ADA and established case law since its passage.  More importantly while we believe the DepartmentеХs motivation in proposing the amendments is well intentioned we are convinced that actual implementation of the changes will have serious unintended consequences that will diminish the quality safety and predictability of ADA services for our riders while significantly increasing costs.  WCCTA is a signatory to the letter submitted to the Docket by a coalition of public transportation entities agencies throughout the United States.  Rather than attempting to reiterate here the positions presented in that letter (with which we fully concur) we are including the full text of the coalitionеХs comments as an attachment.  We will use the remainder of this letter to provide supplementary comments on issue areas in the NPRM not specifically addressed in the CoalitionеХs letter or where we have additional concerns beyond those included with the Coalition comments.   I.Reasonable Accommodation The initial passage of the ADA and its implementing regulations established the legal obligation for each public transit agency to develop and submit to the FTA detailed plans for ensuring that persons with disabilities had the same right to public transportation as the general public.  FTAеХs review and approval of these plans provided an understandable and objective measure of the adequacy of each agencyеХs program in meeting the non-discrimination provisions of the law.  For more than 15 years the FTA-approved plans provided a reasonable and straightforward means of adjudicating and resolving cases alleging civil rights violations.   The de-facto expansion of the standard for ADA compliance (as proposed within the NPRM) based on conditions that will be defined by rider request on a trip-by-trip basis vastly increases public transit operatorsеХ exposure to litigation and creates an untenable situation where operators will regularly face tough decisions requiring them to compromise passenger safety to avoid a the civil rights violation.  In the NPRM discussion of Reasonable Accommodation it is proposed that a public transit operator upon request from a disabled passenger may be required to pick up or drop off that individual at a location other than an established bus stop.  In California this requirement would place the transit agency in direct conflict with a State Supreme Court decision (Bonanno v. CCCTA) that imposed an expanded duty of care on public transit agencies (indeed on all public entities) to make sure that a route traveled to its property (in the Bonanno case a bus stop served but not owned or controlled by the transit agency) is safe independent of any dangerous condition at the stop location itself.  In the Bonanno decision CCCTA was held liable for $1.5 Million in damages and the basis for this judgment was that the plaintiffеХs injuries were caused by a dangerous condition she experienced as she tried to access the transit systemеХs services.  To comply with the expanded scope of California public transit operators duty of care and to establish boundaries for the attendant liability for any damages sustained by passengers en-route to public transit services transit agencies must formally evaluate bus stop locations consider any known incidents or public safety concerns for each location and have on record formal approval of each bus stop location by the agencyеХs policy board. It is simply unworkable for a bus operator to be placed in the situation of having to evaluate and make an ad-hoc decision on a request from a passenger to be dropped off at a location that has not undergone the formal risk assessment outlined above.  The operator may be totally unaware of known hazards or unsafe conditions at the location.  Needless to say the overriding consideration here has to be the safety of those using our systems. The changes outlined in the NPRM tend to prioritize individual convenience over safety and in the process put our passengers at risk.  We urge the Department of Transportation to rescind these provisions in their entirety.II.Trip CountingWCCTA objects to DOTеХs approach for counting denied trips which DOT currently follows.  DOT counts each leg of a trip as denied even if the transit authority can accommodate the passengerеХs request on one or more leg if the authority cannot accommodate each leg of the trip.  This interpretation is contrary to the scope and intent of the ADA.  The ADA requires that disabled passengers have access to comparable public transportation as able-bodied persons.  As the original regulations state the ADA is not intended to be a comprehensive system of transportation for individuals with disabilities or to meet all of their transportation needs.  Fixed route transportation does not always meet the needs of an individual passenger for every leg of a trip.  For example a passenger may have to leave his house early in the morning for an appointment so as to make it impractical for a passenger to take public transit on one leg of a trip.  The passenger may take a taxi to his appointment and then take public transportation home.  Likewise if a disabled person requests a pick up and the transit agency cannot accommodate the passenger within the required one hour window but the transit agency can accommodate the return trip DOT should consider the transit authority as denying one leg of the trip and not two.  It is not reasonable to penalize a transit agency for providing transportation for one leg of the journey.  Instead DOT should judge capacity constraint based on actual denials of a leg of a trip.  This is the only reasonable interpretation under the ADA.III.Comment on Other Issues.  Subsection 6 Mobility DevicesThe original ADA regulations provided general guidance to public transit operators and to the manufacturers of mobility devices on the maximum dimensions and weight of devices that would routinely be accommodated aboard public transit vehicles.  These regulations offered minimal assistance in the development and deployment of safe and reliable securement systems for common mobility aids and effectively mandated that public transit systems accommodate any device that did not exceed the maximum physical dimensions and weight defined by the regulation. Over the past 15 years public transit agencies have done their best to safely accommodate a wide variety of mobility devices including three-wheeled scooters despite the fact that manufacturers have paid virtually no attention to equipping these devices with hardware to allow them to be secured in a dynamic environment of a moving vehicle.  The recent guidance DOT provided on еТSegwayеУ devices illustrates the problem we have with the fact that there is still no standard interface between tiedown systems and the mobility devices themselves.  Under the DOT guidance a passenger could right now be boarding one of our vehicles with a Segway (or conceivably a similar Segway-like device from a different manufacturer) and our driver may be figuring out how to try to secure this device despite the fact that not one of our drivers has ever dealt with a Segway before.  The device has a higher center of gravity than many more common wheelchairs and may need to be secured in a completely different way than a standard four point tiedown to prevent it from tipping or moving during vehicle cornering.  A driver encountering the device for the first time will not know if likely anchor points on the Segway will withstand the g-force stresses which may be generated during the trip.  While the driver will make a best guess about whether the device is safely secured there is no assurance that this is in fact true.  We believe that the users of our systems would be better served by the DOT exercising its regulatory authority to promulgate a common standard for securement and to establish a certification process for manufacturers of mobility devices.  Public transit agencies would be only have a legal mandate to transport devices certified to this standard.  This would ensure the safety of the passengers using the devices as well as other passengers transported aboard our vehicles.We appreciate your considering our comments.SincerelyCharles AndersonGeneral ManagerWestern Contra Costa Transit Authority601 Walter AvenuePinole CA  94564(510) 724-3331charlie@westcat.org ATTACHMENT 1Coalition Letter to the Docket April 26 2006Docket Management FacilityU.S. Department of Transportation400 Seventh Street S.W.Nassif Building PL-401Washington DC 200590-0001Re:NPRM:  Docket No. OST-2006-23985 RIN 2105-AD5449 C.F.R. Parts 27 37 and 38 71 FR No. 38 9761 et seq.  (Feb. 27 2006)Transportation for Individuals with DisabilitiesDear Docket Clerk:We are a coalition of public transit agencies that provide accessible fixed route transportation and paratransit pursuant to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (еТADAеУ). We submit these comments in response to the referenced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (еТNPRMеУ).  The NPRM proposes to further expand ADA obligations on public transportation providers through amendments to the regulations which implement the ADA currently codified at 49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and Part 38 and е¤504 of the Rehabilitation Act currently codified at 49 C.F.R. Part 27.  These comments are addressed to the proposals to add a еТreasonable modificationеУ requirement to Title II Subtitle B of ADA (еТTitle II.B.еУ) particularly with respect to paratransit service to add a еТdirect threatеУ definition and exception to the proposed еТreasonable modificationеУ rule and to establish a Disability Law Coordinating Council through a formal rule.  We have joined together in submitting these comments because we are convinced that this NPRMеХs proposals if adopted will have a significant adverse impact on our agenciesеХ transportation services.   We also support the comments prepared by the American Public Transportation Association of which we are members.  Many of us intend to submit separate comments addressing additional issues relevant to our particular circumstances.We support the concept of accessibility of public transit and voluntarily modify our practices and procedures when it is safe and practical to do so. However we oppose the NPRM's ""reasonable modification"" rule because it would impose a legal obligation to modify service on passenger demand without regard to passenger safety potential costs effects on reliability operational and administrative complexities and local community needs.  The еТreasonable modificationеУ rule if adopted as proposed would produce severe adverse impacts on our fixed route transit and paratransit systems is not redeemed by a proposed еТdirect threatеУ exception and its promulgation would exceed the scope of the powers delegated to the Department of Transportation (еТDOTеУ) in the ADA statute.             DOT does not explain the purpose of its rulemaking proposal relating to the Disability Law Coordinating Council (еТDLCCеУ). Further establishment of such a Council is a wholly internal administrative process that is not subject to the Administrative Procedures ActеХs rulemaking requirements. Our concern is that the Council not be used to insulate decision makers from the industry they regulate or the constituent agencies of the DOT from the Administrative Procedures Act and SAFETEA-LU obligations when issuing еТbinding obligationеУ pronouncements.           We urge DOT to rescind these proposals in their entirety.A.   THE COALITION The coalition submitting this comment consists of ___ transit agencies identified in the Appendix to these comments.  Together we deliver more than ___ fixed route and more than ___ paratransit rides per year and expend a combined amount of $_______ in doing so. B.  COMPLEMENTARY ADA PARATRANSIT AND ITS COSTSThe purpose of Title II.B of the ADA (Public Transportation Provided by Public Entities) was to assure that persons with disabilities would have the same right to public transportation as the general public.  The principal means the statute adopted of assuring transportation access for the disabled was to require that public entities make their fixed route systems accessible to persons with disabilities. For those individuals with disabilities who are prevented from using accessible fixed route transportation public entities were required to create and maintain paratransit at service levels еТcomparableеУ (or in the case of response time еТcomparable to the extent practicableеУ) to the transit operatorеХs fixed route system (42 U.S.C.12143 (a)). As DOT noted in the Preamble to its ADA regulations when issued in 1991 (56 FR 45584 45601):The ADA is a civil rights statute not a transportation or social service program statute. еЙ.Under the ADA complementary paratransit is not intended to be a comprehensive system of transportation for individuals with disabilities.  The Secretary of Transportation explained that it was DOTеХs intent in adopting the regulations to exercise its discretion еТеЙconservatively to minimize the addition of costs to public and private entities beyond what the statute itself imposesеУ( 56 FR 45620). Despite the SecretaryеХs conservative intent in developing the initial ADA transportation regulations (49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and 38) the annual cost of complementary ADA paratransit in the United States now exceeds $1.9 billion dollars   - a number many times more than the official estimates made at the time the regulations were adopted. This is due to two factors: first the inherent differences in paratransit and fixed route make paratransit preferable to more disabled riders than had been anticipated by federal estimates (and claims by disability advocates).  Experience shows that many persons with disabilities given a choice (i.e. able to ride accessible fixed route transit) will elect to ride complementary ADA paratransit despite the fact that it can cost the rider up to four times as much to do so.   Many agencies even offer riders free fare not only for the disabled passenger but also for his or her personal care attendant as an incentive to use fixed route service. Yet any positive effects of those policies in terms of reduced paratransit demand have been negligible at best. The second is that the studies on which the original government estimates were based assumed a substantial denial rate. However beginning in 1998 DOT through the Federal Transit Administration (еТFTAеУ) began to interpret the ADA as requiring a zero denial rate.The ADA emphasized the obligation to make fixed route transit accessible to persons with disabilities as the primary method of achieving its accessible transportation goals not only as a means to give persons with disabilities the most independence in travel and the most integrated mode of transportation but also to promote the most efficient means of achieving the access goal. Public transit in general is a highly subsidized system utilizing some combination of local state and federal funding.  The fare revenue does not cover the actual cost of the ride and the difference is funded by taxpayer dollars.  However on fixed route transit (bus and non-commuter rail) the fare subsidy is far less.  For example a 10-mile bus ride might cost $2.00 of which the rider pays $1.25 for a subsidized cost of $.75 a 38% subsidy. Moreover as ridership on the bus system increases the amount of subsidy needed all other things being equal diminishes.  In comparison paratransit utilizing ADA-required service parameters is a highly inefficient means of public transit.  The same 10-mile ride on paratransit will cost $30.00. The rider cannot be charged more than $2.50 thus requiring a subsidy of $27.50 or a 92% subsidy that must be provided by taxpayers.  Thus for the same ride the subsidy for paratransit is more than 36 times that of the bus ride. In addition increased paratransit ridership does not diminish costs per trip but in many circumstances will increase it.  C.PROPOSED REGULATION:  REASONABLE MODIFICATION OF POLICIES PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES  DOT proposes to amend its ADA and 504 regulations to impose a requirement of еТreasonable modificationеУ of policies practices and procedures on public transportation under Title II B. It asserts that this is a mere clarification of existing law and that it is supported by prior regulatory interpretations and case law.  It contends that for this reason the proposal does not represent a significant departure from existing regulations and policy and is not expected to have еТnoteworthy cost impactsеУ.  All of these contentions are unsupportable.  If  DOT intends to pursue this proposal it must comply with the еТsignificantеУ rulemaking requirements of Executive Order 12866 and its own Regulatory Policies and Procedures applicable to significant rulemakings as well as with Executive Order 13132 (еТFederalismеУ) requiring consultation with state and local governments.  We demonstrate below that this proposed regulation is contrary to existing case law and 15 years of operating experience. Neither DOT nor FTA had prior to last year indicated that transit properties had any transportation obligations beyond those incorporated in the regulations and for paratransit what was incorporated in their FTA-approved paratransit plans.  If adopted this regulation will have a powerful negative impact on the already-low productivity rate of this inefficient means of public transportation and significantly increase the cost of meeting ADA regulations.  Moreover as we also show it is beyond the statutory mandate and therefore if adopted would exceed DOTеХs authority to promulgate ADA regulations.  1.    Analysis of the еТReasonable ModificationеУ Rule and Title IIShows that the Proposed Rule is Outside the Scope of Title II.B. Title II.A precludes public entities from discriminating against persons with disabilities by excluding them еТby reason of such disabilityеУ from participating in public services. 42 U.S.C.е¤12132. Regulations by the Department of Justice (еТDOJеУ) (28 C.F.R. Part 35) flesh out what discrimination means in the context of general public services provided by a public entity.  Historically government programs and activities intended for the general public had been designed without regard to whether those programs and activities were accessible to disabled persons.  DOJ regulations therefore necessarily established a еТreasonable modificationеУ requirement because there are such a wide variety of general public services that developing specific non-discrimination regulations with respect to each of them would be impossible.  However DOJ regulations 28 CFR 35.102(b) specifically exempt public transit because it is the one public service singled out for specific statutory treatment in Title II.B (42 U.S.C. е¤12141 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOT at 49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and 38. DOT regulations as originally promulgated did not have a еТreasonable modificationеУ requirement for public entities and logically so. Public transit is the only public service specifically and separately addressed by the ADA (under Title II.B). The goal of Title II.B is to assure equal access to public transit by persons with disabilities.  For those who cannot ride an agencyеХs accessible fixed route service complementary ADA paratransit comparable to it is required to be offered..  The eligibility design and the еТcomparableеУ operating parameters for paratransit are specified in the original and detailed DOT regulations.  Fixed route operators designed their paratransit systems accordingly and as required by the ADA statute and the DOT regulations submitted a plan as to how this specialized service would be provided (42 U.S.C.е¤12143(c)(7)).  FTA approved the plan when еТ...viewed in its entiretyеУ it provides for service еТcomparable to the entityеХs fixed route serviceеУ and is therefore compliant with the antidiscrimination provisions of 42 U.S.C. е¤12143 (49 C.F.R. 37.147(d)).The DepartmentеХs proposed rule would superimpose on the modifications of the fixed route system imposed by Title II.B including complementary ADA paratransit a requirement to further modify in response to rider demand on a case-by-case basis. We believe that this proposal is unnecessary unworkable and contrary to the intent of the ADA.2.The Proposed Rule Is Not A Clarification Of an Existing Rule. There are no еТreasonable modificationеУ requirements in the original DOT regulations. Further DOJ regulations that do have such a provision are inapplicable to public transportation (28 CFR 35.102(b)). The only appellate court to directly address the issue determined that еТreasonable modificationеУ was not required for activities covered under Title II.B. Melton v. Dart 391 F.3d 669 (5th Cir. 2004); cert. denied 125 S.Ct. 2273 (2005).  Melton involved a plaintiff who sought to compel the paratransit agency to modify its curb-to-curb policy and pick up the plaintiff in an alleyway as opposed to the curb in front of his house. The court determined that the concept of еТreasonable modificationеУ did not apply to paratransit: Because paratransit service is meant to act as the disability complement to established fixed route transportation services this comprehensive regulatory scheme signals that no interim extra-plan modification is statutorily or otherwise required by a public entity when the public entity is properly operating under a FTA-approved plan. The FTA-approved plan is itself the accommodation to the disabled by the public transportation entity. It is the violation of the plan itself that constitutes the prohibited discrimination under title II not the failure to modify the plan to address particularized complaints (391 F.3d at 675).In Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania et. al. v. National Passenger Railroad Corporation (еТAmtrakеУ) WL 1459338 (E.D.Pa. 2005) 16 A.D. Cases 1596 the setting was fixed route transportation and the court persuaded by the reasoning in Melton determined that еТreasonable modificationеУ was not required for matters covered under Title II.B.  DOTеХs assertion that Burkhart v. Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority 112 F.3d 1207 (1997) appeared еТto share the DepartmentеХs assumption about the relationship between the DOT and the DOJ requirementsеУ (71 Fed. Reg. 9762) is misplaced. As pointed out in Melton the Burkhart court did not decide whether or not the transit authority was exempt from the DOJ regulations on еТreasonable modificationеУ because that issue had not been raised in the court below (Melton at  674 n.6; Burkhart 112 F.3d at 1210 n. 1).For more than 15 years prior to the issuance in September of 2005 of its unusual guidance regarding origin-to-destination paratransit service DOTеХs own actions demonstrated that еТreasonable modificationеУ was not a concept applicable to Title II.B.  Since FTA approved our paratransit plans none of which contained a policy to provide modifications of service on rider request there has been no indication that anything beyond complying with the paratransit service criteria was required. Nor can DOT bolster its argument that еТreasonable modificationеУ is a mere еТclarificationеУ of and existing rule by pointing to  its own unprecedented act of issuing in 2005 its first written guidance on paratransit (interpreting the еТorigin-to-destinationеУ requirement) and issued  after this NPRM was drafted.  In that interpretation DOT for the first time contended that the еТorigin-to-destinationеУ language of the regulations meant that the transit operator had to еТreasonably modifyеУ its service model of curb-to-curb service on request of any rider.  Such an interpretation is contradicted by years of contrary interpretation by FTA officials relied upon by transit agencies.  For example on June 14 2003 at the Community Transportation Association of America annual conference in Seattle Michael Winter Chief of FTAеХs Office of Civil Rights sought to persuade transit operators to address mobility needs of the disabled by providing service beyond that required by ADA. He conceded that the paratransit regulations require no better than curb-to-curb service and that whether to go beyond that and provide door-to-door service for ADA eligible riders is left to local decision-making processes.   This was consistent with other FTA written pronouncements indicating that the origin-to-destination language of 49 C.F.R. е¤37.129 means that еТ[t]he exact location of pick-up and drop-off sites are an operational issue not governed by the regulations.еУ   DOTеХs view of the requirements of е¤504 of the Rehabilitation Act has changed as well.. Before the ADA was passed the author of the current NPRM expressly stated that еТspecial accommodationsеУ (the equivalent of еТreasonable modificationеУ) for persons with mental visual or hearing impairments were not required under 504 as interpreted by DOT regulations and concluded that to impose such a requirement would require an amendment to the regulations (52 FR 30803 (DOT Docket 45162) (1987)).  We are unaware of any such amendment ever being made.  3.     The Proposed Rule is Unnecessary.   Specific regulations already establish requirements for accessible fixed route and paratransit service (49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and 38). These regulations provide the accommodation or еТreasonable modificationеУ of the fixed route transportation (a general public service) for persons with disabilities and have been the basis for the design and operation of accessible fixed route and paratransit systems for more than 15 years.  On a practical level the rule is unnecessary because transit agencies do make best efforts to provide modifications requested by their riders.   It is essential however for the good and safety of all of the passengers (as well as to contain the costs of this service which was intended to be a limited service for a limited group of people) that these decisions remain within the discretion of the accountable parties the transit operators.  There are no data in the NPRM to indicate that there is a problem needing correction. A few complaints or lawsuits given the number of paratransit trips given each year(83000000 in 2004 ) and the billions of bus and subway rides annually suggests overwhelmingly that ridersеХ needs in this regard are being met.  Under these circumstances it is inexplicable why the DOT would promulgate a regulation on this subject at all and especially one that imposes a burdensome administrative process not only to make each such determination but also to document compliance.    4.  The Proposed Rule is Improper. The ADA at 42 U.S.C. е¤12143(c) (3) authorizes DOT to set forth the levels of service necessary for ADA paratransit systems to be deemed comparable to the applicable fixed route and therefore nondiscriminatory.  Similarly the ADA at 42 U.S.C. е¤е¤12142 12147 and 12148 specify the requirements for accessible fixed route transportation vehicles and facilities.  DOTеХs proposal to superimpose on these requirements a condition that will be defined only by rider request on a trip-by-trip basis exceeds its statutory authority because it fails to define or otherwise exceeds what is comparable to the applicable fixed route.  The proposed regulation also is procedurally improper because as previously stated the DOT has not complied with the conditions imposed by Executive Orders 12866 and 13132. 5.As to Complementary ADA Paratransit the Proposed Rule Makes No Sense. Complementary ADA paratransit is not a service for the general public that needs to be adapted or modified to meet the special needs of persons with disabilities. It is designed from the ground up as a modification of and alternative to fixed route service to accommodate a subset of persons with disabilities who cannot use accessible fixed route service. There is no rationale for superimposing on the specific regulations regarding eligibility design and operations of a compliant system the obligation to customize each ride upon request.There is no discussion in the NPRM of what consideration if any was given to the effect on paratransit riders if the service were no longer to be clearly defined by regulations that are universally applicable and consistent.  Currently wherever the rider may be when traveling around the country or even if living in one paratransit jurisdiction while working in another and using both systems on a regular basis the rider knows what the service must provide.  By going to a еТmodification-by-demandеУ standard DOT will force transit agencies to change aspects of service across-the-board when enough riders request the same or similar modification because the rule as proposed leaves the agencies with no clear basis for denying specific types of requests. This is so because the logistics involved in responding on a person-by-person day-to-day basis as suggested by DOT would have an adverse impact on service reliability as explained below at C.6 and could add even greater costs and productivity losses than by changing the service across-the-board.  However this means that in any given jurisdiction paratransit service is going to mean something different.  When riders need to use more than one paratransit system (not unusual for those working or attending school in metropolitan areas but living in suburban areas or the reverse) they will not have the certainty of knowing what to expect with regard to each of the service parameters set out in 49 CFR е¤37.131.  Moreover if agencies change the service to attempt to contain the exorbitant costs of this proposed mandate they will simply have set themselves up for demands by some riders to change the system back to the way it was on a case-by-case basis to meet their asserted needs.  ADA mandated accessible mass transit and mass paratransit albeit in a necessarily modified way for the disabled.  DOT by expanding service requirements enunciated in the original regulations through its 2005 formal еТinterpretationsеУ and this proposed rule will effectively mandate individualized transportation service for each disabled person.  .   If such a radical departure from ADAеХs intent is necessary and appropriate it clearly requires legislative not regulatory action.6.  The Proposed Rule Will Add Substantial Uncertainty Operational Complexity Costs and Decreased Reliability.If a transit agency must modify each trip as requested to do so by the rider it is easy to envision a service in which many or most trips are customized. It is not possible to predict all of the circumstances in which modifications might be sought",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and therefore accurately forecast its total potential cost. However DOTеХs positions on at least three such instances are either discussed in the NPRM or in other Department pronouncements. These are door-to-door paratransit service (71 FR 9763) allowing wheelchair users to ride sideways (November 8 2005 FTA Letter to Santa Cruz MTD) and the case-by-case abandonment of designated bus stops on fixed route service (71 FR 9764).  In suggesting that these examples are еТreasonable modificationsеУ DOT makes it clear that it does not consider them to be еТfundamental alterationsеУ of service.  We disagree.  (a) Modification of Paratransit Service.    The safety and productivity costs of on-demand door-to-door service are well known by transit agencies. For those systems currently using a curb-to-curb service model these costs include increased dwell time risk to other passengers and the vehicle when left unattended and decreased system capacity because of lower efficiency resulting in increased operating costs and the necessity of renegotiating many millions of dollars in third party provider contracts.  Dwell time is increased because the driver is helping the rider to the door and returning to the vehicle.  Assuming that an additional four minutes is needed at each end of the trip (pick-up and drop-off) to provide door-to-door service and that one-half of all rides will eventually request door-to-door service we estimate that paratransit variable costs will increase by 10.29% (employee compensation and maintenance running costs would actually increase by more than 10%) and fixed costs would increase by 5.44%.  We estimate that just a single requirement to provide door-to-door service on demand will increase the costs of transit agencies currently providing curb-to-curb by at least 8.18%. Given current predominance of curb-to-curb service models this translates to an estimated nationwide cost in excess of $100000000.    Despite the extraordinary cost that could be incurred nationally (and for each agency that does not currently offer door-to-door service) by just this one service modification the proposed regulation would not stop there but would mandate a host of other customized ride requests each of which have a similar propensity for escalating the cost and reducing the reliability of a paratransit ride while reducing the capacity of the system.  Moreover there is no meaningful procedure through which an agency could verify that any modification requests are in fact compelled by the personеХs disability rather than mere preferences for convenience (of the individual or his/her family).  The following are examples of other than door-to-door modification requests that this coalitionеХs members have received and except for a very few in which riders may not be able to identify a disability-related need it is readily apparent that a claim can be made that the request is disability-related whether true or not: (1) Demands that preclude shared ride or reduce capacity:  ебClaustrophobia combined with other disabilitiesебDesire to transport bulky packages/equipment as part of tools of the trade of the riderебService animal allergies and phobiasебAllergies to perfumes other common chemicalsебRefusal to ride with others based on race or gender physical attributes such as odors behavior of others such as use of obscenities racist remarksебIntermediate stops where driver would be required to waitебDemand for non-stop ride due to physical debilitation before/after medical treatment (dialysis chemotherapy etc.)ебRide with wheelchair or scooter facing sidewaysебSpace for additional mobility aide to be transported with rider using a different mobility aideебSpace for cart carrying six oxygen tanksебSpecific route (smoother roads less bumpy ride) ебSpecified vehicle temperatureебWill not ride with a specific other passenger;

On a practical level to require a system that was never designed or intended to meet all of the transportation needs of disabled persons to customize each ride to meet the riderеХs claimed needs would result in substantial reduction in capacity due to increased inefficiency (i.e. fewer passenger miles per vehicle due to increased dwell times and increase in non-shared rides) thereby substantially increasing both operating and capital costs (b)          Fixed Route Transportation.  It is patently unacceptable to leave   pick up and drop off locations to individual bus operatorеХs discretion based on passenger requests when the decision may result in a civil rights violation. Further there is an inherent risk of increased vehicle accidents passenger injuries and deaths together with the degradation of on-time performance.   . In any event any individual with a disability who cannot use accessible fixed route service as it is operated by the transit agency is by statutory definition eligible for paratransit (42 U.S.C. е¤12143(c)(1)(A)(i)); 49 C.F.R. е¤37.123.  This alone demonstrates that еТreasonable modificationsеУ are not required by current regulations and cannot be required through new regulations.  The statute clearly leaves to transit agency discretion a decision whether to modify its fixed route service beyond ADA requirements to make it available to a larger class of people with disabilities or to provide those persons with paratransit service.The following are examples of fixed route modification requests that this coalitionеХs members have received and like the requests on paratransit a claim can easily be made that these requests are disability-related:ебPick-ups/drop-offs at other than designated bus stopsебSpecific bus type to be dispatched because of securement type/locationебSpecific bus type to be dispatched because of lift/ramp types ride quality or other amenities on the bus.ебAssistance with packages or luggage on boardingебOperator to push wheelchairебOperator to assist rider across nearby intersectionебOperator or crew member to take charge of a service animal during boarding or exitingебOperator or crew member to act as a PCA for the rider who needs one but insists on riding without one.(c)Administrative Problems.  The Department envisions that the local transit agency will make the individual case-by-case determinations as to whether a request for modification  is related to the riderеХs disability and if so involves a еТdirect threatеУ еТfundamental alterationеУ or еТundue burden.еУ If not the request must be granted.  If the request is denied there is the further obligation to seek another means of achieving the goal of the requested modification. All this is further subject to the DepartmentеХs right of review (71 FR 9762-63).  This time-consuming process cannot work in the real world of mass transit. Most requests will occur at the point of reservation or in the field at the point of travel.  DOTеХs proposed rule seems to expect public agencies to entrust to their drivers or reservationists the task of making complex decisions that could expose an agency to civil rights violations and tort liability for injuries deaths and vehicle damage.  Because such determinations will under the proposed rule carry potentially significant legal and operational consequences to the transit agency it is unlikely that any agency would entrust such determinations to anyone below an executive level. Accordingly responsible implementation of the proposed rule is operationally impractical.  Assume an average paratransit service that books more than 1000 rides per day and assuming only 10% of those request a service modification an executive of the agency could not possibly have time to consider and rule on the propriety of 100 requests daily or to complete the paperwork to support each denial and devise an alternative as required by the proposed rule.Finally this proposal is likely to result in unreliable service.   A service that changes daily to meet the specialized needs of that particular dayеХs constellation of passengers will decrease the reliability of the service.  It simply cannot be expected that drivers can reliably master and keep track of the different services to be made available to each customer.  Consequently entirely understandable human failures in this regard by the drivers will result in failed pick-ups or longer dwell times and consequent late drop-offs.7.The Proposed еТDirect ThreatеУ Exception  Definition Ignores Rider Safety and Will Not in Any Event Ameliorate the Defects in this Proposed RuleDOT proposes to incorporate in Title II.B the same definition of еТdirect threatеУ that exists in Title II.A as a basis (in addition to еТundue burdenеУ and еТfundamental service alterationеУ) upon which transit agencies can deny a disabled riderеХs service modification request relating to fixed route or paratransit service (71 FR at 9763-64).  However when the service at issue is transportation rather than all of the other types of government services afforded under and in accordance with Title II.A the definition is inappropriate because it does not permit a decision to deny the modification request based on one of the very likely reasons why it should be denied; namely that if granted it would be a danger to the disabled person making the request.  By common law common carriers have an enhanced duty of care to provide safe transportation to their passengers. Nothing in the legislative history of the ADA suggests an intention by Congress to abrogate this duty especially where it involves the safety of persons with disabilities a group the statute seeks to specifically benefit.  Under DOTеХs proposed approach a transportation agency would be considered to be discriminating against a disabled person by refusing to engage in conduct that was unsafe for that disabled person.  This would certainly be a unique application of civil rights law.  Moreover nondisabled persons do not have a right to demand and receive unsafe transportation for themselves.  It cannot be seriously argued that ADA created such a right for disabled persons.Transportation agencies must continue to provide safe passage for their passengers.  If a disabled person believes that a request has been denied on a pretextual basis then he or she can file a complaint with FTA or litigate directly whether the request was denied for discriminatory reasons rather than on the basis of safety or other non-discriminatory reasons.  This is in keeping with traditional civil rights law; disabled persons do not need a new ADA regulation to press such a claim.  Under DOTеХs proposal the regulation presumes that a denial of a modification request because it would constitute a direct threat to the safety of the disabled person is discriminatory per se.  A transportation agency should not be forced to intentionally engage in conduct known to it to be unsafe for its passengers or face litigation.  This HobsonеХs Choice is untenable.  However even if the safety of the requesting rider were included in the definition of еТdirect threatеУ its addition to the  еТundue burdenеУ and еТfundamental service alterationеУ limitations of the proposed rule could not and will not resolve the fundamental flaws in the еТreasonable modificationеУ proposal which we have brought to DOTеХs attention in these Comments.D. PROPOSED RULE:  DISABILITY LAW COORDINATING COUNCIL The DOT does not explain why it seeks to promulgate by regulation an internal administrative process that the Administrative Procedure Act (еТAPAеУ) clearly exempts because it is a rule of еТagency organization procedure or practice.еУ 5 U.S.C. е¤553(b)(3)(A). Moreover DOT states that the Council еТis in place and functioning effectivelyеУ (71 FR at 9765).  If a regulation were required it would have to have been promulgated in advance of the Council issuing binding guidances thus raising the question whether those issued to date are valid. A stated need to have all of DOTеХsеХs constituent administrations issue consistent interpretations is an inappropriate goal given that the statutory provisions and regulations for the different transportation modes under the jurisdiction of FRA FTA and FAA are different.  Proper interpretations would reflect those differences not eliminate them.While DOT can continue this process with or without a regulation we do not agree that the Council is functioning effectively with respect to agencies subject to FTA.  To date the CouncilеХs actions seem to be focused on overturning all of the settled expectations concerning the ADA which had been based appropriately on guidance provided over all these years by FTA and FTA-approved paratransit plans.  Moreover the process by which prior interpretations are еТoverruledеУ by the Council is poorly designed.  Up to now there has been no attempt to determine if the complaints received by DOT are true; no survey of how widespread the issue may be; no request made for information from public transit in order to fully understand the issue or the potential ramifications of imposing a new еТguidanceеУ; no survey of riders done to determine whether what the complainant seeks is reasonable (and whether if granted would interfere with other ridersеХ service quality).  Consequently if the Council is to continue its legitimacy will depend not on how it was established but by the integrity of its process. Council processes should require sufficient and objective fact-finding and comment from all stakeholders before interpretations are issued and the Council should limit its pronouncements to reasonable interpretations of promulgated regulations and not attempt to create new rules without rulemaking (such as the origin-to-destination and Segway guidance issued by the Council in September 2005).  Given no express or apparent necessary basis for the creation of the Council by regulation we are concerned that its establishment by this process not result in circumventing the APA and the recent amendment to е¤5334 of the Federal Transit Act in е¤3032(l) of SAFETEA-LU enacted in August 2005.  Section 3032(1) requires that the rulemaking procedures under the APA be followed before any FTA statement or guidance is issued that imposes a еТbinding obligationеУ on transit properties and those similarly situated.  The purpose is to require transparency and obtain input from all effected parties before these determinations are made. The establishment of the Council by regulation should not be used to insulate DOT or FTA from this requirement.  Because the Council already exists and it is apparently unnecessary to validate it by rulemaking the proposed rule should be withdrawn. For 15 years under the ADA the DOT delegated to FTA the duty to monitor compliance by transit properties with Title II B including the approval of paratransit plans conducting capacity assessments engaging in complaint review and providing guidance to transit agencies.  This choice was appropriate as FTA funds many such agencies and has a greater specific experience with respect to the practical aspects of public mass transit delivery. We are concerned that the new regimen of using the interagency Council will by minimizing the role of the FTA in this process result in determinations that are ill conceived or impractical to implement.  E.  CONCLUSIONThe thrust of our comments should not be misunderstood.  They do not address the propriety of modifications made every day by transit agencies as a matter of voluntary customer service which currently take into account available resources safety practicality and service impacts. What is here addressed is the notion that the law should require individualized customized modifications of rides on a public transit system where the law already defines what is required for such a system not to be discriminatory. To superimpose such a requirement would create a system that is not comparable to the service provided to passengers on fixed route transportation and thus is beyond the mandate of the ADA. Imposition of legally compelled modifications will likely result in a public transit system that provides poorer not better service to the vast majority of persons with disabilities.Respectfully submittedMark R.

162,DOT,FALSE,0,2006-07-05T23:59:59-04:00,NA,Dear Sirs:As a leader in the State of Florida and itеХs coordinated Transit system I must protest in the strongest terms the proposed rule of not requiring assistance for Disabled individuals to and from Para-transit vehicles to the door of buildings.As someone who is Blind and a user of both Para-transit Fixed Route and Heavy Rail services and representing the largest organization of and for the Blind I tell you that this will cause great harm to those persons least able to deal with this situation.A Blind person may or may not need assistance in all cases but most will.Many Blind people can travel very well independently but all need some assistance at some point especially with the growing number of elderly Blind.Traveling to or from new locations in unfamiliar surroundings can challenge even the best travel skills.Just finding a door steps elevators entrances room numbers or worst of all open ground such as parking lots  grassy or planted areas can and will present barriers to the Blind and other disabilities that can not be coped with and present a clear and present danger to such passengers.Failure to recognize this and not provide the assistance to the door will open services to increase lawsuits and charges of negligence.The ADA states еТPolicies and Procedures will be modified to insure the greatest amount of access.еУI am both a Blind transit user and work for MV Transit as the Consumer Advocate.  I have some 20 years of experience in Transit issues in Palm Beach County and the State of Florida.Recently Palm Beach County received both the most outstanding Urban CTC award from the State of Florida and the same award from the (C.T.A.A.) Community Transportation Association of America at their national conference in Orlando Florida.(We must be doing something right.)We provide this kind of door-to-door service here with the following rules.The driver may not leave sight of their vehicle if other passengers are on board but can assist passengers to an entrance or pathway leading to such.The driver may not cross the threshold of a private residence.The Driver cannot go beyond the lobby of any Public building.The driver may assist a person in a wheelchair up or down one step or to the top of a ramp.The driver is not to leave the person in a dangerous area or situation without assisting the disabled passenger to the exterior door of a building or by helping to orient the person to their surroundings.We never leave a cognitively or vision impaired person in an unsafe place.Such passengers as all timersеХ patients and those with other mental impairments are always taken to the doors and physically transferred to an attendant who signs for custody.Services that do not do this are both morally and fiscally responsible for what happens to passengers when it can be shown that a bad situation was present and the service provider ignored it.The higher incidence of lawsuits for еТcurb to curbеУ service shows that this is a inferior service to еТdoor to doorеУ service and results in a high number of cancelled trips missed trips customer no shows and a higher rate of accidents to passengersIf a service provider is going to take on the Para-transit services for People With Disabilities then they need to provide really safe stable and reliable service to the passengers.These are our NationеХs most frail and vulnerable citizens.  Watching out for their welfare is also part of the job not just carting them to a convenient location for the provider company and pushing them out the door with a wish of good luck on your lips.A societyеХs greatness can be judged by how well its most vulnerable citizens are cared for.  In the Roman Empire each disabled citizen was given two slaves to tent to their needs for life.We donеХt have slaves anymore but we still have a responsibility to take care of our people.Providing the assistance of passengers to and from the entrance of a building is not asking too much.Besides there is an old axiom among the Blind.  That is that good Blind travelers donеХt need anyone to go with them and bad Blind travelers never go anywhere without someone to help them.I am considered a good Blind traveler but there are times in order to go someplace I do need some help to find my way into a building.I pride myself on my ability to travel anywhere alone but I still need help sometimes.  I think that it is only fair that we give what help is needed and asked for.  If I need help I ask for it from our drivers.  If I donеХt need it or just need some good verbal directions I tell the driver I am okay and they are free to go.Please do not pass this ruling.  Continue to require Para-transit Providers to assist passengers to and from the vehicles.  It is the right thing to do.It will be those who can least afford it that will be hurt.David EvansCell: (561) 789-2488MV TransitConsumer AdvocatePresident Palm Beach County ChapterNational Federation of the BlindBoards:MPO Transportation Disadvantaged Local Coordinating BoardPalm Tran Service BoardChair of Para-Transit CommitteeSouth Florida/ Tri-Rail Regional Transit Authority,DOT-OST-2006-23985,Transportation for Individuals With Disabilities,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2006-23985-0160,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2006-07-05T00:00:00-04:00,David Evans,David R.

Employers of a very significant number of our county residents have made known their support for and the necessity of their businesses being on Eastern.  Because companies in the U.S. face so many competitive disadvantages and added expenses versus those of other countries (environmental laws/requirements higher wages scales a multitude of taxes out-of-control litigation just to name a few) this seems a minimal request to grant to help keep these businesses viable.  We Hoosiers would appreciate your assistance in keeping Indiana economically healthy.A meeting held by our County Commissioners and countless letters to the editors of area newspapers have also revealed tremendous support of Eastern Time by residents for occupational personal recreational and child safety reasons.  I would appreciate your counting this letter as solid support of Dubois County's request for being in the Eastern Time Zone.,DOT-OST-2007-28746,Standard Time Zone Boundary in Southwest Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2007-28746-0023,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2006-08-21T00:00:00-04:00,Julie Olinger,Julie M.

165,DOT,FALSE,0,2006-09-11T23:59:59-04:00,NA,We have been looking at this from an Indiana perspective. LetеХs look instead to whatеХs best for the country. This time zone boundary line that passes through Indiana is one of only 3 such lines in the adjacent 48 states. The USDOT has been given the authority and responsibility to place these lines having regard for the convenience of commerce. I am happy everyone has begun to realize that a boundary line is incapable of doing еТgoodеУ and can only cause problems not solve them. The best anyone can do is to place them where they will do the least harm because boundary lines are a necessary evil if we are to have time zones.The least harm is done when these lines are placed where they create the least confusion. Commerce is conducted between time zones thousands of times a day with very few problems as long as the parties recognize the time differences. I submit that itеХs impossible for an outsider to predict where the boundary is in Indiana. The more he knows about time zones the less likely it would make sense to him. This boundary line separates the central zone from the eastern for the entire nation and for that matter the world.  Take a look at IndianaеХs eastern border. It is a perfect straight line. Then compare it to the gerrymander line that now exists. Which one is the least confusing? Keep in mind this straight line was the boundary before 1961. The Central/Eastern time zone boundary was transferred from the Indiana/Ohio state line by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1961 and placed in the center of Indiana where it created the very problems that we are contending with today. This unique action of moving a boundary across a state line and thereby dividing the state was done at the request of a self centered but very powerful special interest coalition. The will of the people was never a consideration. It would be in the nationеХs best interest for the boundary to be moved back to IndianaеХs eastern border where it would be readily understood and very predictable. No one has to consult a map to determine what time zone an Illinois or Ohio city is in. The same should be true for IndianaеХs cities. Convenience of commerce would be best served if Indiana were to be reunited and restored to its natural place in the Central zone. I have never heard a good reason why it shouldnеХt be. Louisville western Ohio and Michigan being misplaced in the Eastern zone is not a good reason for Indiana to be divided and likewise misplaced.It has been 39 years since DOT first become involved with IndianaеХs time problem and it is doubtful anyone with first hand knowledge of the action taken in 1968 is still working for the department. Because of this ruling the people in western Indiana deserve special consideration. Let me explain.In 1966 the U.S. Congress passed the much needed еТUniform Time ActеУ to eliminate the checker board observance of Daylight Savings Time. This Act gave the newly formed Department of Transportation the responsibility for administering the law which required each state to uniformly observe DST or the state could excuse itself from DST altogether. This law was amended in 1972 to allow the states split by boundary lines to observe DST in one zone and Standard time in the other. But this was too late for Indiana which had been divided 5 years before. The Eastern counties were on Standard time and didnеХt want EDT and the Central counties were on DST and didnеХt want Standard the year round. April 26 1967 Governor Roger Branigin petitioned DOT to place all of Indiana in the Central Standard Time Zone. This deferred the observance of the new law for one year. During this the rest of 1967 DOT spent a lot of time in the state trying to solve this problem. In January 1968 the Department announced it was transferring 36 more counties to the Eastern Zone making a grand total of 79 Eastern and 13 Central. The 36 counties including Knox Daviess and Martin had agreed to this compromise in a spirit of state unity with the understanding that none of the 79 would have to observe EDT. 2005 was not the first time DOT had denied an Indiana GovernorеХs petition. As far as I know no hearings were held. I believe the Indiana Chamber of Commerce was involved in the process because it would have been out of character for them not to be. It also contradicts DOTеХs 2005 rationale for rejecting Governor Daniels petition for a state wide review because it was too broad and that such reviews were normally on a county-by-county basis.A group of Indianapolis television broadcasting companies filed suit in the Indianapolis U.S. District Court against Alan Boyd Secretary of Transportation for not enforcing the 1966 Uniform Time Act. The plaintiffs were represented (some familiar names) by Harry T. Ice and James Hawes Ice Miller Donadio & Ryan Clarence H. Doninger William F. Welch and Patrick Smith. Judge Holder ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in July 1968. He admonished DOT that they could not allow Indiana to break the law by not enforcing the Uniform Time Act.The 1969 General Assembly (they were only in session in the odd years) passed a law that placed the state on Standard time. Governor Whitcomb vetoed the bill and much of Indiana did observe EDT in 1969 and 1970. This was one year before Michigan did. We can only wonder if Indiana was on EST when Michigan had their referendum would the results have been different. The 1971 General Assembly overrode WhitcombеХs veto and with the 1972 amendment to the 1966 Act Indiana settled into the arrangement we had until this year when we started EDT.These 36 counties had made a good faith agreement with USDOT to be transferred into the Eastern zone with the understanding they wouldnеХt be required to observe Eastern Daylight Time. Through no fault of its own DOT was unable to keep its end of the agreement. If DOT were to now transfer these counties to the Eastern zone where they would have to observe EDT it would be in effect reneging on a long ,DOT-OST-2007-28746,Standard Time Zone Boundary in Southwest Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2007-28746-0085,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2006-09-11T00:00:00-04:00,Jim Burdsall,Jim Burdsall ,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I may not understand what the stewardess is trying to relay the fear i have if I cannot understand I might be overpowered by several people and be arrested for not ""obeying"" the spoken rule.I believe the movies should be captioned (most movies are already closed captioned you only need a chip placed inside your movie devices it is NOT expensive.  I believe the announcement should also be typed so Deaf people can read from the seats. Think about it a deaf individual can sue DOT and that can be far more expensive than just adding few accessible tools.

I've always had to deal with the change in time from my county to Gibson and Vanderburgh.  It was a nightmare the entire time my children were growing up and is still a nightmare that my family still lives in Knox Co. and me in Gibson and working in Vanderburgh and attending church (church organist) in Knox.  If Indianapolis people had to put up with the difficulties we encounter here in the part of the state they would care more about this issue.  I DON'T CARE WHICH TIME WE ARE ON (prefer Central) BUT ALL OF INDIANA SHOULD BE ON THE SAME TIME!  I work in a law firm and we have MULTIPLE headaches trying to schedule hearings trials etc. (which sometimes are months/years out) because we never know what time the county our attorneys are traveling to is on.  We have had attorneys miss hearings completely be up to an hour late or hour early whichever the case may be.  Even they are confused on how to handle this problem.  When we are talking to other attorneys/courts in other counties we actually have to say ""what time does your clock say right now and in such and such month what will it say.""  It's ridiculous.  PLEASE put the issue up to a people in a referendum and give us the chance to make our case.  INDIANAPOLIS does not seem to care.  Mitch Daniels bullied this through our state government without asking anyone (after he campaigned that he wouldn't).  So please let the people decide.

181,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-03-23T23:59:59-04:00,NA,How might customers and passengers benefit from the information covered by the NTSB recommendation in making their air-taxi service purchase decisions?There will be no benefit to passengers or customers unless the operator does not have the crew on there staff and payroll.  If the owner of the aircraft is paying the crew for most of their salary I feel operational control is lost by the operator.  The ops specs leave too much of a loop whole.  The FAA has not closed the door.  Typical and then we still have a problem. Should any notice requirement if adopted also apply to air charter brokers and other ticket agents who arrange for air transportation for air-taxi customers?NO. There are too may rules that will need to be enforced which just give legal counsel too much ammo.  To what extent is each of the notices recommended by the Safety Board already provided in the normal course of business to persons who travel on air taxis? If such notice is not currently routinely provided what if any practical difficulties would the on-demand air taxi industry likely face in providing the notice?If an operator uses an aircraft the way the rules are now that the crew is not on the payroll of the Operator then the passenger and the broker should be aware of such information.  The crew will always be loyal to who is paying his salary full time.  The occasional day pay or trip pay does not cut it.  This practice should be terminated.  If aa aircraft owner wants to charter then he should pay an operator for crew management and services.  Other than that he should stay out of the charter business.  Then we have Operation Control locked up tight.What costs if any would the recommended changes impose on the industry? Would there be any paperwork burdens? Would there be a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities?I am not sure of the cost but there would be time lost and I would bet in many circumstances the information would not make it to the end user as a result of the short time line that charters are initiated and run.  It is just giving someone fodder to sue because they did not get the word or info.  Then it would cost plenty and the FAA would wash there hands of the whole mess and just violate someone.How might the disclosure of the names of the owners of the aircraft involved in the arranged flights be useful to customers and passengers? What if any practical or privacy concerns would be raised by such a requirement?This is just a bad idea.  If they don't change the requirement of crew payroll status then the owner should be revealed.  If the operator haas the crew on his payroll then the owner should be able to maintain his privacy.At what point in time must any notice if required first be provided to be effective e.g. in printed and Web site advertisements to potential customers when they are seeking information anytime prior to entering into a contract upon signing the contract or anytime prior to boarding the aircraft?Again see the previous answer.  This is a bad idea.  This could have competing charter operators get involved in predatory solicitation.  We don't need this. The whole reason of the two incident causing all the furor is the lack of oversight on an already illegal operation.  Don't add morer regs.  Uphold what you have.If adopted what form should any notice requirement take? That is is verbal notice sufficient or must the notice be in writing? I don't want this to pass.  If it does then verbal would be sufficient.  If the customer claims he was not notified then too bad.  It is a he said she said.Finally what are the practical problems in requiring notice to individual passengers of an on-demand air taxi? Would any notice requirement be sufficient if provided to the person contracting for the flight e.g. the customerеХs broker/agent a corporationеХs travel department or an executiveеХs assistant who arranged the flight?Read this question yourself.  Do you not see the complications you are creating here.  Read all eight of the questions.  I don't even know where to begin to answer.  I am trying to run what wasa a simple charter operation and now has turned into a monster with all this about operational control which was not enforced and now is being readjusted.

Kerstin FoxSIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER SERVICE FOR CRUISES As a travel agent with Hibiscus Travel I attended CLIAеХs (Cruise Lines International Association)cruise 3sixty in Ft. Lauderdale Florida last week. Events like cruise 3sixt are always a great chancefor travel agents to talk to the cruise linesеХ CEOs. Since I specialize in cruises for the deaf traveler I am well aware of the sign language interpreter problem. The ADA (Americans with Disability Act) a law that is effective in U.S. territories including U.S. waters requires that hearing impaired clients have an equal opportunity to enjoy the goods services accommodations and amenitiesoffered by places of public accommodation like a cruise ship. Furthermore effective means of communications like sign language interpreters are necessary to ensure an effective communication with deaf clients. Activities on board of the ships shows or shore excursions can not be communicated by written materialsor exchanging notes since it is not considered an effective communication for this type of entertainment.Certain cruise lines do a wonderful job providing sign language interpreter services on their cruises if requested whether the ship is sailing in U.S. waters or abroad. They provide the service for groups and single traveling passengers alike. It is a good example that providing sign language interpreter service does not cause an undue financial or administrative burden for a cruise line. Deaf clients need sign language interpreter service to equally enjoy a cruise. It is hard to understand why a service that is required by law in U.S. territories including U.S. waters is not being provided. Also to my knowledge no other minority would be denied a service that is guaranteed by law within the U.S. when those passengers go on a cruise sailing abroad. Why is it then that the deaf clients are denied interpreter service on cruises abroad?I felt obligated to address this problem with some of the cruise line CEOs present at cruise 3sixty. I asked them to establish a policy in their company that guarantees sign language interpreter service for deaf clients traveling as individuals or in groups to U.S. destinations or abroad if requested by a travel agent or the individual client. I talked to Micky Arison CEO of Carnival Corp. (member cruise lines are cruise lines like Princess Cruises Carnival Cruise Lines Costa Cruises Holland America and Cunard Line) and to Colin Veitch CEO of Norwegian Cruise Lines. Both gentlemen ask me to submit my request for sign language interpreter service in writing via e-mail. Mr. Arison explained that he will forward my request to all member cruise lines of the Carnival Corp. My request via e-mail went out to Mr. Arison and Mr. Veitch on October 4 2005.

184,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-06-18T23:59:59-04:00,NA,Comments regarding NPRM  for D.O.T. 49CFR Part 39Docket OST 2007 268299RIN 2105-AB87Transportation for Individuals With Disabilities: Passenger VesselsI Barry King am submitting these comments with regard to the impact of the proposed rule making on the operation of sailing vessels certificated as passenger vessels.  My wife and I own and operate a traditional sailing vessel the schooner Mary Day offering week long overnight adventure vacations along remote sections of the Maine coast. While I am only one vessel owner I am specifically concerned about the Maine windjammer fleet and other traditional sailing vessels at risk if the rules proposed by this docket are accepted without due regard for the historic nature of these vessels the adventure learning opportunities they provide and the role they play in tourism related activities here in the Maine.  While these rules will severely impact Maine based vessels there are dozens of vessels with ties to the Maine sailing and boatbuilding industry that will also be impacted.While no one in the world of small sailing passenger vessels would chose to discriminate against any one for any reason there are limits placed upon vessel owners and operators of small sailing passenger vessels.  Passenger safety is of paramount importance to any vessel operator.  The Maine windjammer fleet works under the careful scrutiny of the United Sates Coast Guard and maintains a remarkable safety record.  These vessels are all owner/ operated small business entities that rely on the day-to-day careful watch of each vesselеХs captain and crew to maintain a vigilant respect for the variety of people who come aboard to experience an adventure vacation.  The experiences these vessels provide are as far from a cruise ship experience as one can get.  There are no itineraries.  We take our guests to parts of the coast that most visitors ashore can only read about where islands are still wild where anchorages are largely unvisited and where respect for the wonders of our pristine environment can be discovered.  These 14 windjammers range in size from 46 feet to 132 feet and all carry less than 49 passengers on multi-day overnight voyages.  9 of these vessels are National Historic landmarks.  10 of these vessels have no inboard means of propulsion and work to the rhythm of wind and tide.  Life aboard is simple no cell phones no computers no fax machines and no hair dryers.  Each week is an unpredictable exercise in simplicity and a voyage back in time as much as it is a voyage in the present. While this docket clearly defines that all passenger vessels including еТcruise ships and ferriesеУ are subject to the requirements set forth in the ADA I donеХt believe the writers of the ADA could have foreseen how dramatically this large piece of legislation could impact this tiny еТMom and PopеУ windjammer fleet.  We are not a form of public transportation.  We provide a discretionary adventure vacation experience with no set itinerary and operate in unpredictable conditions. Many of us carry passengers with disabilities at our discretion taking into account the particular characteristics of our vessels the environment in which we operate and the disabilities of those requesting to be aboard.  To sacrifice this discretionary ability an authority granted to us and expected of us by the USCG flies in the face of everything we have ever learned as prudent mariners.  To say that these vessels can be reconfigured to adapt to passengers with disabilities is also imprudent.  These vessels have been built and rebuilt under careful USCG supervision according to accepted marine practices utilizing time honored traditional techniques.  It is no accident that Maine is where these vessels have survived and where people from around the world come to have new sailing passenger vessels built and rebuilt.  One real threat to our industry lies with the vision that if these rules pass physical accessibility standards will be adopted requiring the reconfiguration of small sailing passenger vessels and the future construction of historical American watercraft will be all but impossible. The recent multi-million dollar launchings from Maine boat yards of the newly constructed historic vessels Lynx and Godspeed in Rockport would be a thing of the past.  The current multi-million dollar rebuild of the replica vessel Bounty would be gone from the ways at Boothbay.  We need to recognize now that small sailing passenger vessels are a very unique part of the American merchant marine and have very different operating requirements.Passenger with disabilities come in many varieties and the proposed rules do not clearly define disabilities over which we might have discretion without fear of litigation and for which we will be expected to fit out our vessels and crew.  It is unrealistic to accept the notion that these financially marginal vessels can sacrifice passenger carrying capacity and incur greater operating expenses to accommodate people of all abilities.  Just as human beings have their limits; these vessels have limits as well.  And were it possible to build the perfect small sailing passenger vessel accessible to all it would not be a windjammer. The history would be gone. The wildest islands would still be inaccessible and the adventure would have to be tamed from the thrill of sailing feeling the roll of the waves and the heel of the vessel as she carried her guests away to a simpler time and a wilder place.In response to the query about whether there should be limits to the size and capacity of  vessels covered by this docket unequivocally YES!  I would recommend the limits currently being observed in the first round of the creation of physical accessibility standards.  Vessels carrying less than 150 day or 49 overnight passengers should be exempted.  This would cover most if not all sailing vessels operating under U.S. flag.  S/S 36.21 asks if accommodating some disabilities would fundamentally alter the nature of what we do? YesеЙso let us use our discretion to carry as many disabilities as possible without jeopardizing the history the adventure the untamed nature of what we offer to our guests.  Give us the ability to limit the number of disabled guests we can accommodate (S/S 39.25). S/S 39.33 would allow guests to board without notifying me of any pre-existing conditions that could potentially put at risk all guests and crew.  We donеХt ask guests for their medical history but surely I need some recourse when I discover I have a suicidal schizophrenic aboard.  S/S 39.61 asks if floating docks need different treatment.  When the tidal range is in excess of 12 feet you bet.  S/S 39.91 discusses service animals (seeing eye dogs) and all the care they require a situation not feasible abaord a 46 foot schooner?   I could go on section by section but I hope my point is clear.  Small passenger vessels cannot be expected to meet the letter of this NPRM. The intent of any vessel owner and operator is to carry as many passengers as feasible and to comply with the intent of the ADA where possible.  No operator wants to turn away anyone including a person with a disability.  But the DOT and the ADA must recognize there are feasibility and operational restrictions.   While this DOT NPRM offers the opportunity for waivers upon application relief from undue burdens recognizes some disabilities as еТdirect threatsеУ to passenger safety and mentions еТhistoricеУ vessels in the context of physical standards this docket also makes the assumption that these rules will еТnot create significant added burdensеУ and еТwould have very low costs.еУ  In response to the query as to whether there is a need for review of еТsmall entity-related issuesеУ I believe a thorough review of our operations needs to be conducted by the SBA.  While the DOT does еТnot expect any significant economic impactsеУ I do!  I would be glad to bring representatives of our industry together with DOT and SBA representatives to review this docket and explain in detail the impacts it will have on our industry.  The only DOT financial impact studies I have found record of are over 10 years old and no one in the world of small sailing passenger vessels that I have met has any knowledge of where the DOT came up with it $30000 estimate.  We could not revamp our dockside facilities which we do not even own for that price tag.  Please keep in mind that most of the Maine windjammer fleet operates only 4 months of the year because of navigation limits set by our CG Certificates of Inspection.  That reduces our income generating capacity to one quarter of that of a year round vessel operation that can migrate with the seasons or is permanently based in warmer climates.In closing I ask that the DOT recognize small sailing passenger vessels for the unique vessels they are.  These are not cruise ships or ferries and cannot be expected to conform to the same rules.

185,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-06-22T23:59:59-04:00,NA,OST-2007-26829Our Lake George Steamboat Company offers sightseeing tours every day for six months of each year with 3 boats whose capacity ranges from roughly 300 to 1000.We offer the following comments on the proposed rule entitled еТTransportation for Individuals with Disabilities: Passenger VesselsеУ.We agree with the comments posted on April 19 2007 by Tennessee Riverboat.  Our company too has always done everything we could in order to accommodate all types of passengers.  I personally also agree and understand as an Occupational Therapist with over 20 years experience working with neurologically involved clients that all limitations of function cannot be overcome especially by a small company with limited resources.  In the Discussion area Background:It is stated that this will apply to vessels with a capacity of over 150 passengers.  Depending upon the age of the passenger boat and its configuration some of the proposed rules will be very difficult to implement on our boats.Subpart A Section 39.3:Your suggested definition of a еФcommon wheelchairеХ is еТsuch a device which does not exceed 30 inches in width and 48 inches in length measured two inches above the ground and does not weigh more than 600 pounds when occupied.еУIf the еТcommon wheelchairеУ as defined above was all we were asked to accommodate we would be happy.  However we are seeing more passengers coming in extra wide wheelchairs (which measure more than 30еУ) and in scooters (which weigh more than 600 pounds when occupied).  We have also had passengers brought on board in reclining wheelchairs or Barco loungers (more than 48еУ in length when reclined).  Any device more than еТcommon wheelchairеУ as defined in your draft will require that the passenger in the device actually takes up more than еТone passenger spaceеУ.  In fact a reclining wheelchair ends up taking at least 3 additional dining spaces (behind and on the sides).  These additional spaces we cannot put other paying customers into and we cannot charge the passenger in the wheeled device.Subpart B Section 39.25: еТAs a PVO you must not limit the number of passengers with a disability on your vesselеУ.  Our boat configuration will not allow unlimited passengers in wheelchairs or scooters in the dining room as we must factor in emergency access pathways waitstaff lanes for serving food etc.  Our table configuration must be changed (extra space provided between the tables etc.) when we need to accommodate someone in a reclining wheelchair or an extra wide wheelchair.  Section 39.33:  еТAs a PVO you must not require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice of the fact that he or she is traveling on or using a passenger vessel.еУ  There are specific accommodations for which advance notification is needed in our business.  As above our tables must be moved to accommodate larger mobility vehicles; our passenger capacity decreases as we accommodate these vehicles (due to boat deck configuration).  If we do not have notification in advance we may simply not have the ability to change things after other passengers are boarded and seated at their dining tables.  The only table left once most of the other customers are seated might be the table that cannot be physically reached by a passenger with a mobility device that requires a wider travel lane or large turning radius. This is not easily understood by the passenger whom we cannot accommodate.  Their travel plans might not allow them to wait until the next cruise or come back the next day etc.  Section 39.37: еТmust not require that a passenger with a disability travel with another person as a condition of being provided transportationеУ with the following situations excepted: a) a passenger mentally cannot comprehend safety instructions b) is unable to assist in his or her own emergency evacuation from the vessel c) is unable communicate with boat personnel on safety information or d) is unable to perform personal tasks.  What if the caregiver for such an individual determines that they are capable of caring for 3 or 4 such passengers and then one of the passengers requires complete assistance with toileting leaving the other 2-3 passengers completely unattended?  Are we allowed to require an attendant with each?  If we do not know in advance how are we to provide crew to be designated as the еТpersonal or safety assistant role in such a caseеУ?Section 39.53:  The requirement for a TTY service on information and reservation services is overly burdensome. Many other technologies are used instead.  People making reservations from home are typically on their computers and if adaptation for visually impairment or mobility impairment is required it has already been done.  I think this accommodation is best done at the consumerеХs computer level.Subpart E: Accessibility of Vessels:It concerns us that this section is not thought out prior to some of the other requirements in these proposed rules as the other requirements clearly deal with accessibility.As stated previously there are certain inherent shape issues with a boat as compared with a square empty room.  There are also requirements from Coast Guard and other governmental agencies dealing with passenger vessel safety emergency situations fire etc. which must be complied with before a single passenger sets foot on board.Subpart F Section 39.83: (a) states еТyou must not require such a passenger with a disability [who can readily get on or off a passenger vessel without assistance] to accept assistance from you in getting on or off the vessel.еУThe boat company would be the one involved in litigation should a passenger think he or she could disembark safely contrary to the trained crewеХs determination and come to harm.Yet (b) states that the PVO еТmust promptly provide assistance that ensures that the passenger can get on or off the vessel.еУHow is this determination to be made еР between the passenger who is еТnot able to get on or off a passenger vessel without assistanceеУ and one who can еТreadily get on or off a passenger vessel without assistanceеУ?** Also the Discussion has comments about emergency situations but the proposed rules do not.Section 39.89:  In the Discussion section the Department seeks comments on any special accommodations for getting safety information communicated to persons with cognitive disabilities.  As an Occupational Therapist I think it would be impractical to say any special accommodations should occur beyond what is already done and what is provided for any member of the general public or child or older person.  If the passenger has a cognitive disability of any significance there should be a caregiver with this passenger one on one in order to ensure that passengerеХs safety.Section 39.9: Service animals.This is an area of concern as people do want to bring their pets on board.  If our company is required to take the еТcredible verbal assurances of a passenger with a disability using the animalеУ we will have problems.  First of all we cannot ask a person if they are disabled now we are required to believe their assurances that they need the animal. This could easily turn into a person claiming to need an animal that was indeed only a pet for help with a pretend disability.  How do we accommodate other passengers on that same cruise who have allergies to dog hair or are terribly afraid of animals?Subpart G Section 39.101:  Complaints Resolution officials.We are a relatively small company with many cruises.  I have many years experience as an Occupational Therapist working with clients with neurological diagnoses (adult and children).  еТTraining to proficiencyеУ as described in your Discussion (p.2842) еТincluding how to distinguish among the differing abilities of individuals with a disabilityеУ would be not an easy job.  I think certifying the training or drafting a training curriculum would be quite difficult and actually unnecessary.  Cannot you just recommend minimal common courtesy and sensitivity from both sides: the passenger with a disability and the passenger vessel personnel who make our living by being accommodating to the public (with disabilities or without old or young etc.)One last comment about your Discussion on p. 2842.  You state that this NPRM does not impose significant costs.  For our situation it would most definitely have an economic impact as described previously in the situation of the dining area taken up by extra large wheelchairs etc.  By these rules we would not be allowed to know a large number of passengers needing wheelchairs were coming we would not be allowed to limit the numbers at the same time that we were losing several seats in the effort to accommodate the wheelchair and we would not be allowed to charge for the seats lost.You state that the NPRM focuses on prohibiting unnecessary practices eliminating policies that prevent or inhibit travel by persons with disabilities.  Yet it seems to cover far more than that and it seems to add an economic burden to those of us who are smaller.Our company is already accommodating people in the best way we can.  We added wheelchair lifts to two of our boats in order to allow more access (adding one required adding an additional 34еХ to the center of the boat еР not an easy task!).  This was not mandated we did it to provide service to our customers.  To require more indeed to require the same sort of accommodation from us as from large corporations running large cruise ships is overly burdensome.In your Discussion p. 2843 the Small Business Administration size standards are mentioned (i.e. under 500 employees is a small business entity).  This is a good standard for determining that a company doesnеХt have the resources of a large corporation or cruise line and therefore should not be subjected to these proposed rules (especially the ones such as Sections 39.25 39.37 39.53 and others requiring definite economic outlay in terms of additional employees handouts to customers etc.),DOT-OST-2007-26829,ADA - Passenger Vessels,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2007-26829-0148,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Lake George Steamboat Company,2007-06-22T00:00:00-04:00,Patricia Dow,Lake George Steamboat Company ,2105-AB87,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
186,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-07-11T23:59:59-04:00,NA,The concept of overbooking originated when reservations were made by phone with no obligation to pay.  Now all reservations must be paid in full.  If I pay for a seat and I fail to show that seat is still paid for.  To resell the paid seat is just plain greed.  To then deny another person his paid seat is the epitome of gluttony.  How can this possibly be legal?!  If a cruise line theater or any other reserved seat venue followed this practice there would be lawsuits.  I strongly request that the airlines pay the maximum penalty for their voracity еР a minimum of double the cost of any ticket plus any and all expenses incurred by delay of travel.,DOT-OST-2001-9325,"Air Transport Association of America, Inc. - Petition for Rulemaking",Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2001-9325-0009,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2007-07-11T00:00:00-04:00,William Haderer,William Haderer ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
187,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-07-13T23:59:59-04:00,NA,"HiI would like to suggest that all of the options presented in docket OST-01-9325 (""increasing the $200 compensation limit to $624 and the $400 limit to $1248; increasing the compensation limits to $290 and $580 respectively; doubling the compensation limits to $400 and $800; eliminating all compensation limits and making compensation equal to the value of the ticket with the payment doubling for longer delays; or leaving the current limits in place."") are too limited.  However amongst those options I like the $624/$1248 option the best.""Eliminating all compensation limits and making compensation equal to the value of the ticket with the payment doubling for longer delays"" should only be done if the value of the reference ticket is calculated as (not the value of your purchased ticket but) the cost of the most expensive fare in your class of travel for your specific flight(s).  When you purchased your ticket you traded off flexibility for a cheaper price; the airline traded a lower fare for some guaranteed revenue.  Since they ""cheated"" (breaking their end of your contract once they realized that they had underestimated demand for your specific flight) and overfilled the flight they should have to give involuntarily bumped passengers money based upon the true value of their ticket at the time of the involuntary bumping.  This rule should specifically include ""frequent flier"" miles tickets and those tickets from ""opaque"" booking sites (Priceline hotwire etc) but could reasonably exclude ""employee (reduced) travel"" tickets or ""standby"" type tickets.  Double this compensatin amount for each 4 hours of a delay.  Passengers would have the right to refuse this cash compensation still be transported to their destination on an alternate flight and could then bring a case in small claims court to recover actual damages (a missed cruise etc) based upon the airline breaching of contract.Business airline tickets can routinely top $800 depending on the city pairs and advance booking time yet the current involuntary booking compensation limit is still $200/$400.  I would ideally suggest that a better option would be for the airline in an involuntary bump situation to have to compensate each affected passenger $100 cash for every hour (or fraction thereof) that the passenger is late getting to their final destination (based upon published schedules and whichever flights you are reprotected on at no charge) with no cap.  A 50% discount could apply if the airline gets you to your destination within 2 hours of your original arrival time.  This would encourage airlines to minimize delays to affected passengers in a very substantial way while still allowing them to make money by overselling a flight to a high-fare passenger and getting the (presumably lower fare) involuntarily bumped passenger to their destination quickly and with fair compensation for their (hopefully short) time inconvienance.With the increase in regional jet and propeller fliying by the major airlines these rules should also apply to commuter airlines of at least 30 seats.  If the airline chooses to run a smaller plane for any reason the involuntary bumping rules should still apply (the airline still broke its end of the contract and should not be able to cherry pick the highest fares for travel without compensation to the distressed passengers).Thanks you for taking the time to read my comments.",DOT-OST-2001-9325,"Air Transport Association of America, Inc. - Petition for Rulemaking",Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2001-9325-0037,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2007-07-13T00:00:00-04:00,Douglas Friday,Douglas L.

188,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-07-16T23:59:59-04:00,NA,"Bumping passengers is a violation of the contract between the airline and the passenger. The passenger pays for a service and makes plans depending on that service being performed. Contrary to air traffic disruptions poor weather terrorist attacks and similar events bumping is fully under the airline's control so there is no justification for this violation of a passenger's right to a service. Airlines' claim that they need to be able to bump passengers in order to make up for ""no-shows"" is bogus: they could simply charge the no-shows. They choose not to. So they should be responsible for missed revenues and they should not be allowed to make up for missed revenues by violating other passengers' right to a service that has been paid in full.The only adequate rule in response to airline bumping is to make bumping illegal and to hold airlines liable in court for any damage to passengers that ensues directly or indirectly from bumping. Limited monetary reimbursement (often inferior to the airfare itself) is by no means sufficient to compensate passengers. In all other fields a company who accepts payment is then obliged to perform in accordance to contract unless prevented by factors beyond its control. There is no legal or moral reason to make an exception for airlines.

190,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-07-19T23:59:59-04:00,NA,To whom it may concern:  Once again the people of Indiana are being run over roughshod.  The facts are that the longitude meridians mark the center of time zones in the U.S.  Upon looking at a map of North America one can clearly see that Indiana is firmly in the Central time zone.       The DOT is interested in how time zones effect commerce.  Commerce is effected by the people who are employed by businesses. Two of the largest businesses in Dubois County are Kimball and MasterBrand Cabinets.  Both of these companies have plantscustomers and vendors worldwide.  Both of these companies therefore have people working for them 24 hours a day.       The people of Dubois County want to be on Central time.  On Eastern time the sun would rise in July about 6:40 am and set about 9 pm.  If one is outside until 9 PM and has to be at work by 6:30 AM one cannot get the recommended 8 hours of sleep per night. This lack of sleep has been shown to cause problems with memory loss and lack of good decision skills.Government services are part of economic impact.  Many of the regional offices of the federal government for Indiana are in Chicago. This includes the U.S. Department of Justice and the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has its Region V office in Chicago as well.Personally I propose that you force the rest of Indiana to change to Central Time the natural time for our state.  However since that is unlikely I hope that you will stay with your first correct judgement and leave Dubois County in the Central Time zone.  Finally I would like to point out that those of us who played by the rules preferred Central Time.  Why is it that these bullies and whiners who did not get their way are now allowed to come back and change the rules?

When Martin County converted to Central Time it affected the children at the Community School because the vocational school the high school children attend is in Lawrence County IN which is on Eastern Time.  I use the Louisville KY and Indianapolis Airports which are on Eastern Time because the flights out of and in to the Evansville Airport in the Central Time Zone are more expensive and/or do not service my points of destination.  I have clients who live in Lawrence and Orange Counties and the time difference has created substantial scheduling problems.  I am an attorney and work in several different counties.  The time differences create a conflict and at times I am forced to reschedule court hearings. Often times I am unable to work on cases in the late afternoons because the courts and attorney offices located in the Eastern Time Zone close one to two hours before my office closes. Most of our family members reside in the Eastern Time Zone.  This causes problems when trying to communicate or set up family get togethers.  Our family uses physicians and dentists located in the Eastern Time Zone - again scheduling problems arise.  Shoals is a rural community with few if any stores.  It is much closer for us to drive to Bedford or Bloomington to shop than it is to go to Evansville.  Again however our lifestyles have become complicated by trying to get to the stores and restaurants before they close.  I vote for Eastern Time Zone for Martin County.

A confirmed ticket is a contractual agreement. Default on a contract and you are liable for whatever damages you caused tangible or not. No re-scheduling time rules should remain. Who is to say how much damage a passenger incurs as a function of delay time elapsed. There is no acceptable delay time that exempts either party from defaulting on a contract. If the passenger is late on arriving at the gate is the passenger re-booked on another flight at no expense? How late can the passenger be without incurring cancellation of her ticket? In overbooking the airline is willfully breaking a contract and therefore liable. Let the airlines figure out how to avoid liability: compensation for voluntary re-booking no overbooking ... it is not the passengerеХs problem. She purchased a ticket and entered into a contract that must be respected by both parties. ,DOT-OST-2001-9325,"Air Transport Association of America, Inc. - Petition for Rulemaking",Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2001-9325-0510,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2007-07-24T00:00:00-04:00,Ever Barbero,Ever J.

193,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-07-25T23:59:59-04:00,NA,"Airlines should NEVER be allowed to ""overbook"" the seats on a flight. If any other industry did that sort of thing they would be hauled into court for breach of contract consumer fraud and probably half a dozen other things.  I would like to recommend the following plan as one fair to all travelers and one which would still allow the airlines to maximize their profits:  Instead of over-booking flights and thereby misleading all passengers into a false sense of security with regard to their travel arrangements once all seats on a plane have been booked airlines should be allowed to sell ""space available"" tickets at full-fare prices.  The space-available ticket purchaser(s) should then be put on a ""stand-by"" list based on the time they purchased their tickets and told up-front that the flight was full and what their position was on the stand-by list. In fact a space-available ticket holder could be put on ""stand-by"" lists of all flights to his/her destination leaving over a 48 hour period if he/she so agreed. Under this plan everyone holding a regular ticket would be given a boarding pass FIRST and space-available ticket holders would get any remaining seats. Those holding space-available tickets would know from the outset that there was a chance that they would not be able to board a particular flight but that in the event no seat could be found for them on that flight or on a slightly later but still acceptable flight their full ticket price (minus PERHAPS a very small handling fee - but this should never be more than about $25) would be refunded as soon as the last flight for which they were on stand-by took off without them.No one would ever have to be involutarily bumped.  The only people who might not get to fly would be those who had waited until the last moment to purchase tickets and they would have no cause for complaint because they would have been told ahead of time the conditions of their space-available ticket.  No matter how badly someone needs to fly somewhere they have no cause to complain if there simply are no tickets available.  But when someone makes plans and purchases a ticket weeks (or even months) in advance in order to be in a certain place at a certain time but then get bumped because the airline oversold the flight and winds up missing the very event they were planning to attend being refunded the value of the bumped portion (up to a max of $400 - which might not even cover its cost) just doesn't begin to compensate for the harm they have suffered! For example if a man purchases a $1000 ticket to so he can attend a special sporting event in a distant city and then gets bumped off his flight and can't go until the next day the entire flight is now worthless to him - and he has also wasted whatever money he spent to purchase the sporting event ticket and possibly lost the value of a motel room as well.  A $400 refund is a slap in the face!  The fact that people remain angry about such events for years into the future ought to be evidence enough that such ""involuntary bumping"" is simply wrong and deceitful.  No other business would be able to stay in business if they treated their customers that way.  Airlines should not be allowed to get away with it either.  ""Voluntary bumping"" on the other hand should be allowed to continue. Since everyone engages in it voluntarily it doesn't hurt anyone and can even be a helpful.  I can see no reason whatsoever however why the airlines even need to be ""involved"" in such voluntary transactions.  In the event that more people want to fly that there are seats on a plane passengers holding a boarding pass should be free to negotiate directly with space-available ticket holders and even swap tickets with them if they desire. (e.g. ""Sure I've got a regular ticket to on this flight and I can hang around another day or so. Pay me $200 cash and you can have my seat on this flight and I'll take your space-available ticket and hope to get on a later flight out... or if I don't I can cash in your space-available ticket for the full-fare amount you paid and catch a bus to whereever I need to go."" OR ""You say your mother is dying and you need to get to Chicago right away oh you poor dear you go ahead and take my ticket and I'll take your place in the space-available queue... no no you don't have to pay me any extra... you've got enough to worry about."") For security's sake (and I suppose to keep people from scalping airline tickets if that is a concern)  it might make sense to ensure that such free-market transactions took place only at the boarding gate and only between regular ticket holder and space-available ticket holders.  The only thing airlines really need to do is make an announcement that there are space-available passengers looking to arrange a deal and that anyone interested in negotiating with them should step over to a particlar area.  Once deals are made both passengers involved would go together to the ticket counter to arrange for the names on the tickets to be swapped out.Under the plan outlined above airlines don't need to lose any money and nobody EVER gets shafted. Airlines can still do their thing with regard to adjusting ticket prices to maximize profits - they just can't do it at the expense of someone they have already agreed (i.e. CONTRACTED WITH) to carry for a given price.

194,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-07-25T23:59:59-04:00,NA,An efficient system for compensating passengers for overbooked flights would assign a dollar value to true costs related to the missed flight itself. The current system is an attempt at this with fixed compensation to passengers. While on average the current payment system may be less than sufficient compensation or perhaps more it largely absolves airlines of the true cost to an individual passenger.For instance a vacationer traveling from New York to Miami may bear a true cost of less than $200 for the inconvenience of overbooking. As a business traveler who often takes long trips both coming and going in a single day with a short window to meet with others in between flights the same delay could have a monumental cost.Using an adversarial model like arbitration or the courts as is typically used to determine financial loss and compensation in business-to-business transactions the airline would be forced to compensate me for this loss. The current system changes airlinesеХ incentives significantly encouraging them to take into account far less than the true cost of my losses.Because of the time and venue issues that would be associated with the use of courts to determine losses related to airlinesеХ behavior a system of arbitration is more desirable.Assigning to airlines the true cost of a passenger involuntarily removed from a flight would enable them to more effectively design their yield models while providing them with a market value for the cost of overbooking as an input into those models.As a practical matter since even efficient arbitration takes time involuntarily removed passengers should be offered a minimum payment such as the current $200 and $400. Beyond this they should have the right to submit written arguments to arbitrators under contract to the Department of Transportation. The airlines would have the right to reply followed by a judgment from the arbitrator. Since even the simplest arbitration process may be overly difficult for many travelers to navigate and because the losses for individual travelers (particularly vacationers) may be insufficient to bear the cost of legal counsel the system would need to allow for recognition of classes.One of the great lessons of the last 20 years is that the exposure of companies to the free market is not just that it provides benefits for consumers but that it also rationalizes corporate decision-making. The current system uses incentives that inherently create undesirable outcomes. Simply raising the compensation requirements would change very little.,DOT-OST-2001-9325,"Air Transport Association of America, Inc. - Petition for Rulemaking",Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2001-9325-0627,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2007-07-25T00:00:00-04:00,Benjamin Shoval,Benjamin W.

195,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-07-30T23:59:59-04:00,NA,"The timezone issue in southwest Indiana is complicated...but need not be so.  Governor Daniels' decision push to place us all on DST was a good one.  However it then raised the bigger issue: which time zone will we observe 12 months per year?I grew up in Dubois County and will move there again in the spring.  I currently live with my family in Warrick County and work in Vanderburgh County.  My husband works in Dubois County.  As you can see we are one of the many families that straddle multiple counties and are greatly effected by the changes proposed.  Quite honestly we can live with any outcome.  The bigger question is ""What solution brings the greatest good even knowing some will be inconvenienced?""Eastern Standard Time may not be ideal for all of Indiana.  However the reality is that 2/3 of the state (and much more of the population) is quite content with that time zone.  The Evansville region has in the past suggested that we should stay on Central because we are connected heavily to Kentucky and southern Illinois.  In fact few of our residents travel to these locations to work.  By far the flow is Kentucky and Illinois workers coming into southwest Indiana to work.  Though we appreciate their work in our state their convenience should not be placed above our own residents.I believe that Vanderburgh Warrick Posey Gibson and Spencer should join the 5 counties in southcentral Indiana in the move to EST.  There would at very least be a number of folks and companies inconvenienced by this move.  However the greater good of having all (or almost all) counties in the state observing one time would have many benefits including:  1. Stronger regionalism in southwest Indiana  2.  Better connectivity and unity to our state capitol and the rest of the state.  3.  Demonstration of a willingness to put others' preferences before our own for the greater good.Life is filled with difficult challenges.  As parents we try to teach this principle to our children.  As adults it is time for us to step up and role model this principle.Sue Ellspermann",DOT-OST-2007-28746,Standard Time Zone Boundary in Southwest Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2007-28746-1560,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2007-07-29T00:00:00-04:00,Susan Ellspermann,Susan J.

198,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-07-31T23:59:59-04:00,NA,I support the proposed change for the Petitioning Counties of Daviess Dubois Knox Martin and Pike to be moved to Eastern Time.  While I live in Monroe County I work as the Public Affairs Officer at NSWC Crane which is located primarily in Martin County.  So daily my husband (who also works at NSWC Crane) and I encounter the difficulties of living in one time zone and traveling to and working on another time zone.  This impacts me personally in getting to and from work at strange hours and it always impacts me personally in that I have a grandson that my husband and I assist with who lives in Monroe County and on many occasions we need to pick him up from Day Care for our daughter who is a single mother continuing her education in order to improve her quality of life for herself and her son.  The change in time from one time zone to the other makes it difficult to get to the Day Care on time to get our grandson.I work many hours at my job and often do not get home now until about 9 or 10 pm Eastern time due to the loss of an hour when getting home.I also see the daily impacts on travelers coming to NSWC Crane (and to other activities located at Crane) for business.  They travel in to Indianapolis (on Eastern time) and then on to Crane (on Central time).  Although we explain the difference to them many times visitors are confused by the time difference either missing meetings or showing up early or late due to the change.  This causes disruption and much confusion.  We schedule many school tours at NSWC Crane throughout the year as well including an annual Science & Engineering Fair encouraging math and science.  We have schools from both time zones participating and it is difficult for the schools in the Eastern time zone to schedule and participate with the other schools.  This has caused a great deal of confusions as well.  These are just a few examples and I know there are many more and countless individuals who are sharing those stories with you.  Thank you for consideration of this change and hopefully for making this change soon!,DOT-OST-2007-28746,Standard Time Zone Boundary in Southwest Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2007-28746-1751,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2007-07-31T00:00:00-04:00,Sue Webster,Sue Webster,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
199,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-08-06T23:59:59-04:00,NA,     I have been a practicing lawyer in Tell City for over 30 years.  I have a busy private practice plus I am a part time deputy prosecutor.  My main geographical areas are Perry Spencer Dubois Warrick and Vanderburgh counties where I routinely go to court for clients.  It is much more convenient for my clients and me if all these counties were to continue on Central.  For years Perry and Dubois were on eastern for 6 months and then on central for 6 months.  It was confusing to say the least to schedule court hearings at that time.  Now with all of these counties on Central it is much more convenient and less confusing for clients to attend court hearings.  Even if Dubois is granted its request for Eastern  Perry should remain on Central from my perspective.    To reiterate the STATS Annual Commuting Trends Profile from 2005 of the 12353 who live in Perry County and work  3173 of them work outside Perry County.  The top five areas receiving workers from Perry County are Warrick County Spencer County Vanderburgh County Dubois County and Kentucky.  Only 971 of that number work in Dubois County and the remainder work in Central Time Zone areas.  Thus the vast majority of those workers work in the Central Time Zone and not the Eastern.  For their convenience we should remain on Central.     Finally I address the issue of grades K through 12 extracurricular schedules.  I had 2 children graduate from Tell City High School in the 1980's.  From 7th grade upward they were engaged in various extracurricular activities which required travel away from Perry County.  At the time Perry County was on the same time as Gibson Posey Vanderburgh Warrick and Spencer Counties from April until October. The remainder of the year Perry County was an hour ahead of those counties. Attendance at any event in those counties for the MAJORITY of the school year resulted in my children returning home one hour LATER than if all the counties were on the same time.  This caused students to study an hour later on school nights with one hour less sleep on those nights.  This was not a good situation for the students.  Presently Perry County is on the same time as those counties which is Central.  For those Perry County students who now have to travel to schools in the Eastern zone  while it is still inconvenient they will return home an hour EARLIER than the situation my children faced.  They will not lose the one hour on those evenings and it is in the best interest of all of our students in Perry County to remain on Central.   ,DOT-OST-2007-28746,Standard Time Zone Boundary in Southwest Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2007-28746-2013,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2007-08-06T00:00:00-04:00,James Tyler,James G.

201,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-08-07T23:59:59-04:00,NA,It appears that if the DOT does make the decision to take these counties to Eastern that they will be revisiting this in a few years.  It is clear that a large part of the population wants to remain on Central Time and half of the Eastern Time Supporters believe we are not going to observe DST anymore.  We warned the DOT of this but apparently they chose not to listen.  Changing are counties will cause havoc with lawsuits of school times to lighting at bus stops.  The cause will go from the executive branch to the Judicial Branch so that maybe they will look out for the health and safety of the TRANSPORTATION of our children.  People will stay away from the businesses who would rather see our children in harms way rather then make the necessary changes to accomodate the time diffences with a few suppliers.  It is a sure thing that the commissioners will not be around for long and then we will use the accurate information that shows these counties belong on Central Time.

205,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-08-20T23:59:59-04:00,NA,"TIME ZONE SUMMATIONThe time zone situation in SW Indiana has been a much debated subject since the Summer of 2005.Each of the five counties held time zone hearings.Im Martin county the commissioners had three and invited representatives from NSA Crane to come and none did.Many citizens of the five counties called into local court houses to vote on time zone preference and also attended the meetings in their local counties.The general feeling amongst the residents of the counties was that Cenatral time would be the best time zone for the five counties.The commissioners then voted to proceed in that direction.Originally the DOT did not include MartinDaviessand Dubois in the NPRM in 2005 to move along with KnoxPikeand Perry counties to Central.Upon further submissions of convenience of commerce evidence for these countiesa DOT time hearing in November of 2005 in Jasper Indiana in which local officials spoke of the need to be in the same time zone as each others county and the Evansville region to the south which was currently on Central time andlastly a reccomendation by Governor Daniels asking that the SW region of Indiana not be seperated since it is a ""NATURAL REGION"" the DOT moved the five counties to Central time on January 172006.Stating in their final ruling what we in the six counties which is mainly rural have more in common with each others counties and the Central time region to the South than any counties we border on Eastern time.Our counties are in the same econmoiceducation and workforce developement regions designated by Indiana.This was the correct decision by the DOT.   Almost immediately the Crane Employee Association having figured out they would have the majority of their employees in a different time zone cried foul.A representative for this Association showed up at a Martin county commissioners meeting in early February saying the NSA Crane would be hurt observing Central timea time zone Crane had been in line with the majority of the year for decades but still this was the Crane Employee Associations position.The Crane Employee Association ran letters to the editor in the Loogootee Tribune and Shoals News in Martin county to get inconvenienced citizens to pressure local commissioners for new time zone meetings.After accomplishing this a new time zone hearing was had at the 4-H building in which many Eastern time county Crane employees came to and some local citizens.The est crowd was around 300 at this meeting most were not from Martin county.Martin county has a population of around 10000 people.Hardly a GROUNDSWELL FOR EASTERN TIME"".Martin county commissioner Mike Dant spoke to the NSA Crane commander and asked if the base would function alright on Central time in a sense he was asking would Central time hurt NSA Crane.The commander replied no.Indeed it has not hurt Crane.Central time has caused personal inconveniences for the majority of Crane's Eastern time employees but many have flex scheduling and all have a liberal leave policymuch better than private sector employees.Since more cross time zone boundary commuters will be burdened if the boundary is moved again especially to Toyota employees and the DOT noted this in the NPRM that the commuter numbers do not support a time zone change the boundary should stay where it is at currently.Crane employees are no more important than the employees form the five counties who commute to the original Central time zone or those from that region who commute to our five counties.Indeed this number is greater so it makes no sense to burden the majority of commuters to appease the minority.We have around 3400 citizens in our five counties commuting south to the original Central time zone and less than a 1000 commuting to the current Eastern time counties.These numbers speak for themselves.Martin county ended up voting to re-petition for Eastern time but no action would be taken until they found out what Dubois county would do.entries fill this docket about the Dubois county re-petition process and the intimidation and coersion tactics used against Central time supporting commissioner John Burger until he cahnged his vote to Eastern making the vote in Dubois county 2-1 for Eastern time.The rest of the counties then fell in line with the Eastern time position and the process started.The law firm Ice Miller LLP out of Indianapolis was hired to drive the Joint Petition through.They made their first filing last August.The documentation was weakinaccurateand misleading and was easily picked apart by the pro-Central time people who do their research and work on this issue after they get home from work and on weekendes.However Central time supporters have one advantage over Ice Miller LLP which is that they live in the region.There is no need for me to expand on the numerous Ice Miller errors for they are all documented in rebuttal documentation which is on this docket.The DOT cited regional connections in it's January 172006 ruling.CONVENIENCE OF COMMERCE EVIDENCE WHICH SUPPORTS CENTRAL TIMEHEALTHCARE AND HOSPITALS in the region including close by specialists in Evansville all support the region remainiong on Central time.MAJOR NEWSPAPER in the region is the Evansville Courier which dwarfs the Indianpolis Star in circulation in the five counties and contrary to the assertions of Ice Miller LLP does cover manymany events and news stories on the five petitioning counties.Scanned articles have been submitted to the DOT to show this to be true.COMMUTER NUMBERS As stated by the DOT in the NPRM the commuter numbers do not support a time zone change for the five counties.CELL PHONE SERVICE This is provided for the five counties out of Evansville and if the five counties are moved to Eastern time will cause a incinvenience because free minutes which are available at 9:00pm Central would then not be available until 10:00pm Eastern in the five counties.LOCAL SCHOOL CORPORATIONS There are fifteen school systems in the five counties and only a few have even bothered to submit for wanting to return to Eastern time.The Loogootee school system in their part of the Joint Petition mainly just wants to be in line with the other five counties which they are already.Mentioned by the Loogootee Superintindent is that the teachers are split in this school system about time zone preference.The Shoals school system in Martin county because it sends a grand total of 15 students to a vocational school in Lawrence county complains of a inconvenience because of this but the adjustments have been made and every student is managing to get to school on time.The Jasper school corporation which by the way is a member of the BIG EIGHT ATHLETIC CONFERNCE all untied in the Central time zone which will be split up if the bounday is moved causing a inconvenience in school athletic events states bascially they have education meetings in Indianapols a few times a year and because of the time zone difference these personnel attending have to stay overnight because they can not possibly get up at 4:30am to drive to Indianapolis.They should tell that to all the working people of SW Indiana many of whom get up that early every day.A study of all 15 school corporations atheltic activity of boys basketball which is the most attended by Mr.Rocky Byrd who did a COMPLETE breakdown not just five schools like Ice Miller LLP used shows the least inconvenience is for the five counties 15 school systems to reamain in the Central time zone.This submission is available on this docket.FACILITIES OF HIGHER EDUCATION The facilities most available to the residents of SW Indiana are Vincennes University(Knox county)Vincennes University Jasper Center(Dubois county)Oakland City University(Gibson county)University of Evansville(Evansville)University of Southern Indiana(Evansville)Ivy Tech(Evansville).Many students from Sw Indiana as well as western Kentucky and Illinois can easily commute to these schools.They are all currently in the Central time zone.So I ask the DOT why seperate them? Also two new Manufacturing Technology schools will be built in Dubois and Gibson counties which will be seperated if the time zone boundary is moved again.ECONMOIC PARTNERSHIPSThe five re-petitioning counties are all in the same economic region and in point of fact are located in the Evansville commerce region.They are also in Bureau of Economic Analysis region 54 designated the Evansville Kentucky region.These counties also have formed specail pacts with several counties in the original Central time counties to their south.Much has been made by the Westgate Crane Tech Park especially by several of the members who are on that board and have submitted to this docket and that most people believe stand to gain from this venture.The Tech Park is located in three counties MartinDavieesand Greene.Most of the developement so far has been in Martin and Daviess counties.This venture will add very little in the way of jobs for Martin and Daviess counties.One look at the Crane employees and where which counties they reside in will show the DOT this.The Tech Park will be the same way meaning most of it's employees will be from MonroeGreeneand Lawrence counties.Indded like the Crane base employees these people will pay property taxesshop and conduct business in their home counties.They will not be doing business in loogooteeShoalsor Washington or residing here.They never have and never will.The only gain martin and Daviess counties will ever see from this developement is possibly down the road some taxes from the property and that will be it.A newspaper article sometime back highlighted the fact that this venture will create around 700 jobs and as I stated the majority of these people will not come from Martin and Daviess counties.So while the Wesgate Crane Tech Park overall is a alright thing for the area it is no reason to change a time zone boundary.The buildings are being built and everything is proceeding.CLOSEST MAJOR AIRPORT The closest major airport to the five counties is Evansville and now that they will be offering connecting flights to Indianapolis this should satisy the convenience of commerce issue reagrding this situation.Very few everyday citizens from these five counties fly regularly.The business people from Dubois county from the major comapnies have company planes so this issue is resolved in my mind.FROM WHERE DOES THE REGION GET IT'S SUPPLIES OR PRODUCTSAccording to the Joint Petition just less than half of these supplies or products comes from other than the Eastern time zone.WHERE DOES THE REGION EXPORT IT'S PRODUCTS According to the Joint Petition two-thirds of the products exported goes to other than the Eastern time zone.Neither of the afore mentioned statements regardin imports and exports supports a time zone change.BUS AND RAIL SERVICE In my mind this issue has no importance to this rural region.It would in Washington D.C. or another major city but not here.RECREATION The biggest draw in this region and for the state for that matter is Holiday World in Spencer county.It's president supports Central time and many of it's employees would be burdened with a time zone change.This business receives over one million visitors annually and grosses near forty million dollars.The French Lick Casino argued by Ice Miller LLP in the Joint Petition is a 24hr a day seven day a week entity.Time zone is of no importance.Paoli Peaks also cited by Ice Miller is able to operate effectively apprx three months a year.Patoka Lake is a destination if studied would show most visitors to this park and lake will come from the Central time zone since to the northsouthand west of this area the immediate counties are all on Central time.Fishing tournament participants if from the Eastern time zone can simply make allownaces in their schedules since I am sure that is what participants from the Central time regions have done all these years in the five months they were not in line with our counties.Also if one just wants to go to a casino to gamble Casino Aztar in Evansville is very close by if one wants to be on the same time as their home countyalthough why this is a issue is beyond me since the French Lick casino and resort is open 24 hrs a day seven days a week.Travelers Workers from Carne going on travel contary to what they assert do not leave from Crane base which is on Central time when they go on travel.My relation works at Crane and travels frequently for Crane.These are planned trips and they leave from there home and since the majority of Cranes employees reside in the Eastern time zone if they choose to fly out of Indianapolis there is no problem.As for business travler coming to Crane and flying into Indianpolis being inconvenienced or not knowing what time it is or what time zone Crane is in.Somehow I suspect most of these people fly all over the United States even to states like Kentucky and Tennessee which have split time zones.I am sure eduacted people plan there trip in advance and adjust themselves to the time zone whether in a state with a split time zoneCentralEasternMountainor Pacific time.The argumet these travlers to Carne from out of state are some confused clueless group of people never has added up.TV STATIONS When taken as a whole this group of counties receives the majority of it's TV signals from Evansville.We have three Evansville stations in Loogootee which I and others have listed numerous times to this docket and we are the farthest northeastern county near the time zone boundary.However if someone prefers a Terre Haute news cast we have these availbale for residents at convenient times so they will not miss them contrary to what some on this docket have asserted.There is a 5:00pm and 6:00pm Central time Terre Haute news cast as well as 9:00pm and 10:00pm Terre Haute news casts in Martin county.The best severe weather reporting hands down comes from WEHT channel 25 Evansville AMS certified meterologist Wayne Hart.They will interupt programing for extended periods of time to track severe storms in this are.a few years ago a NEXRAD Dopplar radar site was constructed in Gibson county.The NPRM by the DOT noted the TV station informatyion was insufficient to support a time zone change.RADIO SIGNAlS The best radio signal strength comes from stations within the counties themselves or to the south in the original Central time counties.Contrary to Ice Miller LLP's assertions about obscure AM radio stations in Indianapolis being a hot ticket around here I nor anyone I know listens to said stations.I am sure there is something I have forgotten but these are just a few strong reasons regarding convenience of commerce as to why SW Indiana which is called the TRI-STATE because of ties to western KY and Illinois also in the Central time zone as to why this region should remain united.Doing so emphasizes our strong regional connections and allows for the benefits to be realized for all the counties and the region and allows the region to to better position itself to realize advantages in economicculturalsocial and civic activities thereby serving the convenience of commerce. The governor's office has taken to advertising in the Loogootee Tribune for Eastern time comments in which a scanned copy has been submitted to this docketand Michael McCully of the governors office contacting Pike county to have mis-information spread about possibly being seperated from the other four counties in regard to time zone in order to get some more pro-Eastern comments. We who support Central time feel we have submitted enough convenience of commerce evidence since this process began last Summer which we hope the DOT is giving consideration to.We feel the NPRM should not be granted for Eastern time for all of the reasons and evidence we have submitted in this process.The Joint Petition should be denied and no final rule issued.There are thousnads of businesses in the five re-petitioning counties and only a handful are submitting for Eastern time at the urging of local Cahmber of Commerces.A number of businesses are actully submitting for Central time so if they are doing well and managing why can't many of the global companies that are complaining?These businesses main complaint is not being connected to the Eastern time zone observing states which they have never been in line with the majority of the year anyway for the past decades!None of them have shown verifiable losses and every time they complain about Central time ther'e another newspaper article showin many of these businesses having record profit margins and even expanding while being on Central time.They have all been noted on this docket.RESIDENTS OF THE FIVE PETITIONING COUNTIESThere are over one hundred thousand residents in these counties but just a few thousnad have chosen to comment.If there is such a ""GROUNDSWELL FOR EASTERN TIME"" as asserted by the Joint Petition where is it at?It is not on this docket.If ther was such a GROUNDSWELL FOR EASTERN TIME  and if so many people were suffering great inconveniences on Central time doesn't it stand to reason given the media blitz and many links posted all over the internet to this docket that there would be more pro-Eastern time comments?This docket is running very close comment wise.I have read every one of them.There are probably a few more pro-Eastern time comments but given the assertions by the Joint Petition about the ""GROUNSWELL FOR EASTERN"" it""s pretty close.Since so few are commenting for Eastern time out of the hundred thousand plus residents of these counties it stands to reason they must either be happy with the current time zone or indifferent to it.Many of the pro-Eastern time comments are geared toward inconveniences of schedules and everyday life.These inconveniences will be transferred to a even larger group especially in regard to commuters should the DOT grant the Joint Petition and move the time zone boundary again. Take for example my county Martin a county with around ten thousand residents so far I think maybe 70 -80 comments if that.Most of these comes from Shoals on the Eastern edge of the county and although there are more for Eastern time it's no landslide.I submit this is not enough of a GOUNDSWELL FOR EASTERN TIME in my county or any of the other four to move this time zone boundary again.The number of residents complaining in these five counties works out to less than 1% of the total county population in each county.I do not what the DOT thinks about this but that doesn't add up to a ""GROUNDSWELL FOR EASTERN TIME"" to me!I am aware the process is not about popular opinion on time zone assignment but after all the Joint Petitionasserted this ""GROUNSWELL"" exisited not we who support Central in fact we have constantly stated to this agency it doesn't exist and in my opinion this has been proven correct.The people and special interest groups who pushed this re-petition effort are a narrow band oif people.Some are influential business leaders and citizens who are used to getting their way.Many ignored the process in the Summer and Fall of 2005 the few that didn't did not like the fact that they did not get their way and the commissioners and the DOT to a extent have granted all of these people a ""do over"" proceeding if you will.I would ask that the DOT not destroy the quality of life of the citizens of SW Indiana especilly the number of cross time zone boundary commuters which is a greater number of inconvenienced commuters if the boundary is moved again by rewarding these people with the tactics they employed to get us to where we are currnetly in this process.These tactics have been well documented on this docket.Lastly I will address the fact the entire congregation of a church was submitted to the DOT under the church's letterhead as supporting Central time.Several of these people have submitted to this docket that they did not give permission for this I nor any other Central time supporter I know condones this action if true.However the other side in this debate has sunken to much lower depths in trying to get Eastern time approved for the five counties and they have been numerous and documented to this docket.Dubois county4Centraltime.com can advertise or do whatever they wish to promote their cause.This is democracy and it's a whole lot better than lies from the governor's office or advertising by the governor's office for Eastern time comments.The governor is supposed to support the local decision and citizens decision not his preference.The time zone must be decided by local citizens and their commissioners.All local citizens not just the few who are complaining about Central time.Eastern time supporters are free to do what the wish and in fact have had several email campaigns to do just that.If they wanted to start a web site for Eastern time more powere to them.But make no mistake about it the power players politiciansspecial interests and a paid for Indy law firm is already a powerful force for we everyday citizens who support Central time to go up against.I am at the end now and the debate is at a end for the moment.I believe it will never go away.The county commissioners and other officials and state representatives asked Senior Council Kaleta and the DOT in a Novmber 2005 Jasper hearing to be place all of their counties in the Central time zone with the Evansville region and it's Central time counties.The DOT granted this request on January 172006.They got waht they wanted now it's time to give it a chance.These counties all voted to re-petition by May of 2006 after just a few months of being in the Central time zone because a vocal minority and special interests pressured them to.By the way if Perry county is added to any of the afore mentioned catagories in regards to the region remaining in the Central time zone it's a even stronger case for Central time.Moving the boundary will accomplish nothing.It will just inconvenience even more people.So for the last ime I respectfully ask the DOT to deny the Joint petition and leave things as is.The counties have not provided enough evidence to warrant a time zone boundary change.Please leave all six counties untied in the Central time zone.RespectfullyPhillip NorrisMaritn county resident     ",DOT-OST-2007-28746,Standard Time Zone Boundary in Southwest Indiana,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2007-28746-2762,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2007-08-20T00:00:00-04:00,Phillip Norris,Phillip Norris,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

208,DOT,FALSE,0,2007-09-04T23:59:59-04:00,NA,"HelloI would like to suggest that all of the options presented in docket OST-01-9325 (""increasing the $200 compensation limit to $624 and the $400 limit to $1248; increasing the compensation limits to $290 and $580 respectively; doubling the compensation limits to $400 and $800; eliminating all compensation limits and making compensation equal to the value of the ticket with the payment doubling for longer delays; or leaving the current limits in place."") are too limited.  However amongst those options I like the $624/$1248 option the best.""Eliminating all compensation limits and making compensation equal to the value of the ticket with the payment doubling for longer delays"" should only be done if the value of the reference ticket is calculated as (not the value of your purchased ticket but) the cost of the most expensive fare in your class of travel for your specific flight(s).  When you purchased your ticket you traded off flexibility for a cheaper price; the airline traded a lower fare for some guaranteed revenue.  Since they ""cheated"" (breaking their end of your contract once they realized that they had underestimated demand for your specific flight) and overfilled the flight they should have to give involuntarily bumped passengers money based upon the true value of their ticket at the time of the involuntary bumping.  This rule should specifically include ""frequent flier"" miles tickets and those tickets from ""opaque"" booking sites (Priceline hotwire etc) but could reasonably exclude ""employee (reduced) travel"" tickets or ""standby"" type tickets.  Double this compensatin amount for each 4 hours of a delay.  Passengers would have the right to refuse this cash compensation still be transported to their destination on an alternate flight and could then bring a case in small claims court to recover actual damages (a missed cruise etc) based upon the airline breaching of contract.Business airline tickets can routinely top $800 depending on the city pairs and advance booking time yet the current involuntary booking compensation limit is still $200/$400.  I would ideally suggest that a better option would be for the airline in an involuntary bump situation to have to compensate each affected passenger $100 cash for every hour (or fraction thereof) that the passenger is late getting to their final destination (based upon published schedules and whichever flights you are reprotected on at no charge) with no cap.  A 50% discount could apply if the airline gets you to your destination within 2 hours of your original arrival time.  This would encourage airlines to minimize delays to affected passengers in a very substantial way while still allowing them to make money by overselling a flight to a high-fare passenger and getting the (presumably lower fare) involuntarily bumped passenger to their destination quickly and with fair compensation for their (hopefully short) time inconvienance.These rules should also apply to commuter airlines of at least 30 seats.  If the airline chooses to run a smaller plane for any reason the involuntary bumping rules should still apply (the airline still broke its end of the contract and should not be able to cherry pick the highest fares for travel without compensation to the distressed passengers).Thank you for considering my input.",DOT-OST-2001-9325,"Air Transport Association of America, Inc. - Petition for Rulemaking",Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2001-9325-1221,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2007-09-04T00:00:00-04:00,Jeff Crawford,Jeff C.

I'm also writing on behalf of a larger coalition of over 16 community small business and democratic party organizations and over 100 community leaders opposed to the use of federal stimulus monies (TIGER funds in this case) for Seattle's Mercer Corridor Project.  Already the Mercer Corridor project is 100 million dollars over original cost projections and the City is simply seeking to alter criteria you use for granting these funds so they can secure these funds to cover cost overruns.  The Mercer Corridor Project also does not meet a real transportation need in Seattle and will actually make traffic congestion worse in the Eastbound Direction. The project is located in Seattle's South Lake Union - it is home to developer Paul Allen's plans for a biotech hub in this area - and merely serves as a beautification project to enhance land values in this growing area.  I've attached a letter identifying coalition members opposed to this project.The City of Seattle will be seeking 50 million of TIGER funding for this project and it does not meet grant criteria for receipt of these funds.  Regarding criteria for use of these stimulus funds economic recovery monies must serve a purpose in this case a real transportation purpose which this application does not but most important of all these funds are designated for ""economically distressed areas"". We want to emphasize that this must remain the highest priority and key criteria for use of these stimulus monies. In order to skirt this key requirement and you may check the Seattle City Council record Monday June 1st 930 AM Council Briefing our City has asked you to de-elevate the importance of this criteria and instead give priority to ""economically growing areas"".  This is a clear attempt to skirt the key criteria and direct funds precisely where they are not needed in Seattle and for a project that will do nothing to reduce traffic congestion in our city as indicated by 3 independent and even city sponsored studies.  It's simply a beautification project serving one large development company and aimed at moving traffic away from his key waterfront properties.  Already the State Legislature decided not to provide stimulus funding for the Mercer project precisely because it did not meet recovery act criteria.In Seattle there are an identified 30 bridges in critical need of repair - many of them located in parts of SE and SW Seattle - truly low income and distressed areas.  This does not include a backlog of over one-half billion in road and street and sidewalk improvements mostly in these distressed communities. Yet our city will forgo seeking stimulus monies for these projects in favor of a 50 million dollar request for Mercer - primarily to serve the developer agenda of one man - Paul Allen - and his development company Vulcan Inc.  We urge you to retain as your most important criteria for use of these funds - economically distressed communities. It would be a breach of the voters faith and the recovery act to do otherwise. Only these communities deserve these funds. Sadly our city doesn't seem to care and would abuse this program.  They are seeking to have you change criteria that would undercut the intent of these recovery funds.  On behalf of the Coalition opposed to use of stimulus funds for MercerJohn V. Fox for the Coalition4554 12th NE Sea. Wa. 98105206-632-0668    mailto:jvf4119@zipcon.netAlso see following letter providing more detail as to why no stimulus funds should be used for the Mercer Corridor Project.  Instead of meeting current proposed criteria the city is seeking to alter the criteria to move it's application up as priority - here is our letter submitted to oppose use of stimulus funds to local officials:Organizations and Community Leaders Opposed to Use of Stimulus Funds for Seattle‰ЫЄs Mercer Corridor ProjectMarch 12 2009The Honorable Julia Patterson ChairTransportation Policy Board Puget Sound Regional Council1011 Western Avenue Seattle WA 98104Dear Ms. Patterson:As residents and community leaders from across Seattle we are writing to strongly urge you to deny the City's $80 million dollar request for federal dollars for the ""Mercer Corridor Project"".  The City has submitted this request for at least that amount in federal funds drawn from the stimulus package now being initiated by the President Elect Obama. Our mayor is seeking these funds to fill a growing funding gap given that project costs have skyrocketed from $90 million four years ago to over $200 million today.Earmarking monies for the Mercer project would represent a gross misuse of stimulus package dollars given that this plan does not address either a regional or local transportation need in our community. Under the Mayor's plan Mercer would be widened and turned into a 2-way tree-lined boulevard where it runs through the South Lake Union Neighborhood between I-5 and the Seattle Center. Valley Street that now absorbs much of the westbound traffic from I-5 would be narrowed with that traffic funneled onto Mercer.  City Council staff and the City's Department of Transportation (SDOT) have acknowledged that these costly changes will do absolutely nothing to reduce traffic congestion along that corridor and will at certain intersections make it worse. In fact there are at least three studies now that have been done which confirm that this preferred two-way Mercer plan will exacerbate traffic problems in South Lake Union.  One study done as part of the preliminary environmental review cites delays of traffic by as much as 7-18 minutes in the eastbound direction if this plan is implemented. The Mayor's planners also have tried to argue that reconfiguring Mercer will help move traffic through downtown during State Route 99 and Alaskan Way Viaduct construction.  According to the City Council‰ЫЄs analysis no research shows that the proposed changes will in any way alleviate congestion during this construction.By contrast in 2000 there was a plan preferred by the community and by our former Mayor Paul Schell that was called the ""small and simple"" fix which if implemented would have cost only $10 million (in 2000 dollars). That plan also would have done more to reduce congestion in the area but it was dropped from consideration after our current Mayor took office and after the City sold all the properties along Mercer to billionaire Paul Allen.  Put simply today‰ЫЄs Mercer two-way alternative is a 'pork barrel' project that was devised to mesh with redevelopment plans now occurring in South Lake Union where Mercer is located. That plan is driven by Paul Allen's Vulcan development company which owns nearly 50% of all developable land in that area and especially along Mercer and Valley streets. The Mercer project is designed to redirect traffic away from Paul Allen's view properties located along Valley street closest to the lake and push it all on to Mercer - at a cost of over 200 million dollars (and climbing).  Paul Allen will also benefit when the City buys back land along Mercer he owns - now very expensive land the City sold to him only seven years ago at rock bottom prices.This is precisely the kind of project the Obama administration has said they would not support for use of stimulus package dollars.  It also would be the wrong first step for the incoming administration to take especially when there are so many real pressing transportation needs in our region with a price tag of over 15 billion dollars including nearly a one billion dollar backlog of critical road sidewalk and bridge repairs in our city's neighborhoods.  These are the kinds of projects that desperately need these stimulus funds not the Mercer project. City engineers have identified 33 bridges in our neighborhoods in serious need of repair some bordering on unsafe.  To preference Mercer over these needs strikes us as a serious breach of the voters' trust. These are projects that have been waiting years for promised dollars and meet the president elect's most important criteria for receipt of stimulus funds - they are shovel ready i.e. ready for immediate start-up. By contrast the Mercer Project faces months if not years of extensive environmental review and likely litigation due to community opposition. It's time to pull the plug on the Mercer project.

The methods are meant to assist in providing ideas that may help to lessen a lot of the ongoing administrative issues that continue to plague the DBE Program and cause unnecessary certification delays incorrect certification/decertification decisions varied interpretations on DBE program requirements etc. 1.COUNTING OF DBE CREDIT FOR ITEMS OBTAINED BY DBE SUBCONTRACTORS FROM OTHER SOURCES PARTICULARLY THE PRIME CONTRACTOR FOR WHOM THEY ARE WORKING ON A GIVEN CONTRACT; (no comment at this time)2.WAYS OF ENCOURAGING RECIPIENTS TO BREAK UP CONTRACTS INTO SMALLER PIECES THAT CAN MORE EASILY BE PERFORMED BY SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE DBES KNOWN AS UNBUNDLING;a.WHAT STEPS DOT CAN TAKE TO FOSTER UNBUNDLING ADVOCATE GREATER USE OF THE TECHNIQUEi.Ensure that when unbundling does occur recipients DO NOT still place a goal as this has been happening with some of the unbundling that has taken place; Reiterate that not ALL contracts require warrant need a goal.ii.Require that each recipient unbundle the % of contracts equal to their annual goal; for example if their annual goal is 15% and they let out about 20 contracts that year- then at least 3 MUST be small enough for small businesses to compete successfully; perform as a look ahead based on past year‰ЫЄs goal achievement (this is not a set-aside or quota as ALL interested firms DBE and non-DBE can bid on these smaller projects).iii.Recipients must show what proactive measures (specific details) they took during the year to ensure that there was DBE participation via race-neutral means in their Annual DBE Accomplishment reports (December-DBE/March-ACDBE).iv.Recipients must give credit to Primes when they provide evidence that Primes unbundled contracts to attract small businesses v.Provide a monetary incentive (more federal grant money?) to recipients who unbundled and achieve small business participation via those contracts; in alternative- recipients in a region vie for 1 federal grant that is awarded based on who achieved the highest DBE participation via unbundling.3.POTENTIAL WAYS OF IMPROVING THE DBE APPLICATION AND PERSONAL NETWORTH (PNW) FORMS;a.NATIONAL DATABASE FOR UCPs TO ACCESS. The database should include (1) firms certified as DBE and in which states certified; and (2) firms that have been decertified and reasons for decertification (3) copies of site visit reports. The database should only be accessible by UCPs and no personal or financial information will be released unless DBE provides written consent. Ongoing Maintenance and cost of this may be an issue but perhaps is handled by all UCPs paying for a portion of it with additional federal aid? Or to be funded directly by DOT or funding through application fees for multistate certification or by fees charged to Primes for confirmation of a DBE‰ЫЄs certification.i.Nationalize only the PNW/Business Size Review by FAA/DOT in Washington DC; a small fee can be assessed to each state to offset cost of CPAs consultants etc. This centralizes this piece of the certification process and allows states to continue to review other areas of application and local information and may help to decrease number of certification appeals to DOT and subjective/varied interpretations of PNW.b.Place UCP Application on FAA/DOT website or OSDBU and that is the ONLY place that applicant can obtain the application and submit to UCP; guarantees that the same application is used by all.4.POTENTIAL WAYS OF IMPROVING PROGRAM OVERSIGHTa.UCPs required to submit an annual audit report to FAA detailing the year in review of certification decertification mandatory on-going training/refresher course on certification for certifiers;b.Alternative FAA/DOT surprise audits and take a sampling of certifications/decertifications and review for consistency.c.Ongoing case file history on OSDBU website or FAA/DOT website that details actual cases (certifications/decertifications) what was the outcomed.DOT/FAA do an annual certification training every year; with breakout sessions specific to certain areas of interest (PNW- i.e. count of retirement); if cost is issue- do webinar.e.All certifiers should be required to take training and pass a test and achieve a certain grade to be able to be a certifier? FAA/DOT perform regional training sessions (4x a year)-required as mandatory for all UCPs and certification staff to attend.f.All applicants asked to send comments on the application process to DOT/FAA after certification decision made; no incentive to do so but those who do may provide ongoing insight on issues that need to be resolved with the process. 5.POTENTIAL WAYS OF REDUCING BURDENS ON FIRMS SEEKING CERTIFICATION AS DBEs IN MORE THAN ONE STATEa.NATIONAL DATABASE FOR UCPs TO ACCESS. The database should include (1) firms certified as DBE and in which states certified; and (2) firms that have been decertified and reasons for decertification (3) copies of site visit reports. The database should only be accessible by UCPs and no personal or financial information will be released unless DBE provides written consent.

Or to be funded directly by DOT or funding through application fees for multistate certification or by fees charged to Primes for confirmation of a DBE‰ЫЄs certification.b.Absolutely require a time-limit within which certifying entity MUST respond to new certifying entity seeking site visit report; (30 days).  This has been an ongoing issue for certified DBEs seeking certification in other states as original certifying entity has not always been timely in responding to new agency seeking site visit report. c.All currently certified firms in one state seeking certification in another state MUST be put on a fast track (30 days or less) application process after showing proof of out of state certification and submittal of all documents within their power and pending opportunity (LOI) (does not include site visit report to be submitted by certifying entity). i.FAA/DOT maintains a database of all site visit reports only to be accessible by UCPs as needed.d.National Certification Reciprocity is acceptable if there is National Certification Training that is mandatory of all certifiers otherwise issues regarding Forum Shopping etc will happen.e.Split entire U.S. into 8 regions and require that states that fall in those regions form a Regional UCP and that they have a mandate on how certification is to be handled; this mandate should be uniform for all 8 regions and reviewed/approved by FAA/DOT- Appoint a Regional UCP Director for each region from FAA/DOT who should receive annual/quarterly reports on Regional UCP‰ЫЄs program.,DOT-OST-2009-0082,Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program; Potential Program Improvements,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2009-0082-0046,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2009-07-09T00:00:00-04:00,Anonymous,Anonymous,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As an attorney I have represented small socially andeconomically disadvantaged businesses seeking participation as a DBE infederally-assisted contracts in all but two of our nation‰ЫЄs states. Thus I havedeveloped a great deal of practical experience and knowledge of theadministration of Part 26 and its effectiveness at leveling the competitiveplaying field for DBEs seeking participation in such contracts.PROPERLY EMPHASIZE PART 26 OBJECTIVES REGARDING INCREASED DBE COMPETITIVENESS While the Objectives of Part 26 include ensuring that only qualified DBEs arecertified for participation in this program the program‰ЫЄs written objectivesplace much more emphasis on increasing a DBE‰ЫЄs ability and opportunity tocompete for federally-assisted contracts. In practice however recipientsthroughout the nation place the largest amount of their resources on thecertification objective with post-contract-award compliance enforcement drawingthe second largest share of a program‰ЫЄs energies. The ‰ЫПplaying field‰Ыќ‰ЫУor RFPsolicitation and pre-award competitive process is largely ignored. Given thiscontext it is not surprising that there are no studies that present astatistically significant improvement in the competitiveness of DBEs forDOT/FAA-assisted contracts much less any study that concludes that anyimprovement can be directly attributed to the implementation of Part 26.In terms of competition for the award of a contract the only real DBE programmechanism designed to effect the ‰ЫПplaying field‰Ыќ is the program‰ЫЄs monitoring ofa Prime‰ЫЄs ‰ЫПgood faith effort‰Ыќ in complying with the contract‰ЫЄs ‰ЫПDBEParticipation Goal‰Ыќ. However Primes and program administrators throughout thenation engage in a myriad of practices that result in the appearance ofcompliance with Part 26 regulations but that in substance circumvent theintent of the program and regulations. Some of those practices as engaged in by Primes include:1)Submitting ‰ЫПGood Faith Certification‰Ыќ forms which fail to list all DBEs thatpresented themselves to the Prime as Ready Willing and Able (RWA) DBEs for theproject. Thus when a DBE program administrator contacts the DBE‰ЫЄs on the GoodFaith Certification form the administrator is never made aware of other DBEsthat expressed to that Prime its interest in participating in the project/contract.2)Engaging in negotiations with and obtaining commitments from DBE firms eventhough its (the Prime‰ЫЄs) intent is to submit a Proposal with a ‰ЫПGood Faith‰Ыќwaiver request and with the intent of submitting a proposal that omits thecommitted DBE.3)Sending ‰ЫПblast‰Ыќ solicitations of participation to DBE‰ЫЄs whose business is inno way related to the subject matter of the project.4)Rejecting interested DBEs on the grounds that:a)‰ЫПThe DBE is redundant to the team‰Ыќ‰ЫУi.e. that the Prime will go with a NON-DBEto obtain the services or materials provided by the DBE. This justification is ablatant rejection of the overall intent of Part 26 and ergo ought to be apresumption of non-compliance with Part 26;b)‰ЫПThe selection committee will only count black-owned DBEs towards the DBEparticipation goal.‰Ыќ This reason is given even where no properly-supportedrace-specific goal has been created as in the City of Birmingham;c)‰ЫПThe selection committee will only count local DBE‰ЫЄs towards the DBEparticipation goal.‰Ыќ This reasoning is farcical given that projects whichtrigger DBE program requirements are usually sought after by Primes and DBEsfrom across the region and even from across the nation; andd)‰ЫПThe RFP mandates consideration of only DBEs that are on the local DBElist.‰ЫќThis justification is given even where the RFP clearly allows forout-of-state DBE participation in the contract (which by the way is allowed onmost of the RFPs that I have read). These types of practices are common throughout the industry and are used tosuch an extent that Primes everywhere are engaging in conduct that stronglysuggests that they consider compliance with DBE program requirements especiallyat the contract competition phase as an optional rule of play on this playingfield. Thus it is critical to the substantive implementation of Part 26 that DBEprograms close these gaps by either requiring the Prime to pull DBEs from anational list of DBEs or by maintaining a reporting mechanism whereby all DBEscan learn of RFPs and all interested DBEs can register their interest inparticipating in any given project or by requiring both activities. Byrequiring both a DBE compliance officer can refer to the ‰ЫПInterestRegistration‰Ыќ list to use in the verification of a Prime‰ЫЄs good faith effortsand Primes will be less able to avoid real compliance with Part 26. RECOGNIZE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PLAYING FIELD IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF PART 26Please also consider the following situational factors that contribute toreducing the effectiveness of Part 26 in achieving its ‰ЫПplaying field‰Ыќ objectives:1)Participants in federally-assisted contracts come from a regional and anational pool of contractors and sub-contractors. Yet DBE programs base theirdisparity studies and ‰ЫПmarket area‰Ыќ on a much smaller geographic area. Thisbasis and the recipient‰ЫЄs resulting ‰ЫПpool‰Ыќ of DBEs falls egregiously short ofa real or accurate reflection of the actual playing field for these contracts.To compound the problem project administrators occasionally require a currentlycertified out-of-state DBE to be ‰ЫПin-state‰Ыќ certified before the RFP submittaldeadline. These practices demonstrate that being a certified DBE hardly gets thedisadvantaged business unto the playing field much less able to move about itwith the other competitors.2)Primes are usually large firms that also often have internal marketingdepartments with teams of 10 20 or more individuals to prepare proposals.Truly small socially and economically disadvantaged businesses do not have suchresources and often cannot afford to allocate staff to the writing ofproposals even though they are competent to deliver on the project. CurrentlyI know of no recipient that addresses this situation.3)Often Primes further restrict the DBE‰ЫЄs competitiveness by requiring the DBEto commit exclusively to that Prime and/or prohibit the DBE from participatingin any other Prime‰ЫЄs team. 4)Project administrators do not as an industry practice allow DBEsub-contractors to compete independently from non-DBE Primes for portions of afederally-assisted contract. Further it is unrealistic for a DBE‰ЫУespecially aprofessional services DBE to spontaneously indicate their interest in a projectby submitting a proposal or cost estimate to a Prime as the DBE will not beprivy to the Prime‰ЫЄs approach to the project and to the Prime‰ЫЄs intended scopeof work for any necessary team members. Here again the DBE is ineffective as areal competitor for any portion of the federally-assisted contract.5)Large Non-DBE Primes do not compete for the federally-assisted contracts thatare too small to trigger compliance with Part 26. Yet project administratorsare not required to consider DBEs participation for these contracts even thoughmany DBEs would appreciate increased opportunity to compete for them.In order give substance to the implementation of Part 26 DBE programadministrators must routinely survey and educate themselves as to the practicesoccurring during the RFP process and must use that information to developinitiatives that are narrowly tailored to achieve the Part 26 objectivesregarding DBEs‰ЫЄ competitiveness and opportunities.REQUIRE CERTIFICATION VIA RECIPROCITYThe current practice by ALL recipients of refusing to recognize out-of-stateDBEs imposes an unfair and excessive burden on socially and economicallydisadvantaged businesses and unreasonably restricts the DBEs ability to competefor any federally-assisted contract in which it is RWA to participate. Thissituation must be corrected.A survey of my own DBE clients demonstrates that Part 26 has done little tostrengthen DBEs‰ЫЄ competiveness for federally-assisted contracts. In factparticipation in the DBE presents as an unjustifiable cost to the economicallydisadvantaged business. I found that on average my DBE clients spent $1.80 tobe awarded $1.00 as a DBE on federally-assisted contracts. The survey alsodemonstrates that my DBE clients spent an average of 8.5 hours completing thecertification application (excluding site-visit) and an average of $600 inincidental costs to prepare and submit the application. Given that transportation construction projects are not the type to repeatthemselves frequently contractors and DBEs whose mainstay is transportationconstruction must seek work across a wide geographic range. However even thoughthe CFR‰ЫЄs allow for certification via reciprocity only two states in fifty haveoffered even a truncated certification process. Not one state offerscertification via reciprocity. Thus a DBE must submit complete certificationapplications to many recipients if it wants to be considered as a DBEparticipant for transportation projects occurring throughout its own market area.This situation is untenable and undermines the entire DBE program. Its continued existence is made even more egregious given that the certificationprocess and form is narrowly prescribed by Part 26 and that recipients aremandated not to stray from the process or the form. That recipients are allowedto claim a general distrust of other recipients‰ЫЄ certification process isunreasonable and shoves the burden of the program on the very entities theprogram is designed to benefit: socially and economically disadvantaged businesses.Certification via reciprocity should be the rule. Further once certified undera Part 23 or Part 26 administered program the DBE should be listed as aproperly certified DBE throughout the nation. It should then be theresponsibility of the recipient to demonstrate cause for requiring submittal ofan application from a properly certified DBE. DEVELOP IMPLEMENT AND MONITOR A STRONGER OVERSIGHT PROGRAM FOR NON-PRIMARYRECIPIENTSCurrently Non-Primary Recipients number in the hundreds once municipalities andregional transportation organizations are tallied. Yet even though theseentities are required to comply with Part 26 I rarely find that such arecipient has substantively met the requirements of the Part. Almost everyrecipient-municipality or recipient-regional transportation entity that I haveencountered has either deviated grossly from the Parts‰ЫЄ requirements andobjectives or has simply wholly failed to meet them. Further it is not uncommon for such a recipient to issue an RFP yet to make noinformation available regarding their DBE program its staff its policies orits monitoring and enforcement strategies. A recipient‰ЫЄs failure to publish orto provide public access to any DBE program statements mechanisms etc. rendersthe recipient‰ЫЄs participation goals easily ignored or manipulated by Primes andeven by project managers as happened recently in the City of Birmingham.Further when the recipient does not advertise information on how or to whomto present concerns about their DBE program the contract award process etc.this leaves the concerned party with little recourse other than to pursue aformal complaint or litigation to resolve what may be best resolved informally.Unfortunately it is also not uncommon for federal offices that are responsiblefor oversight of these recipients to be completely unaware of the recipient‰ЫЄsnon-compliance.Thus a comprehensive oversight or auditing program of Non-Primary Recipients‰ЫЄDBE Program would be instrumental in providing information to recipient DBEprogram administrators. Further every recipient that issues a RFP should berequired to coincidentally publish the entirety of their DBE program policiesand enforcement mechanisms as well as the contact information for the office orpersonnel responsible for processing concerns and complaints whether formal orinformal. Failure to do so should trigger a timely audit and imposition ofappropriate adjustments.SUMMARY OF COMMENTSFor the following reasons current administrative policies and proceduresgreatly reduce Part 26‰ЫЄs effectiveness at creating opportunities for DBEparticipation in federally-assisted contracts and impose significant undueburdens on DBE‰ЫЄs seeking participation in the Part 26 program. First DOT civil rights officers and DBE program administrators across thecountry place the majority of their programs‰ЫЄ energies on the certificationprocess. This practice is at the expense of developing implementing andmonitoring policies and procedures which provide substance to Part 26‰ЫЄs otherobjectives especially those intent on leveling the ‰ЫПcompetitive‰Ыќ playing fieldand creating opportunities for DBE involvement in federally-assisted contracts. Second because DBE programs policies and administrators fail to implement andmonitor substantive programs aimed at the RFP solicitation processnon-disadvantaged firms continue to engage in a myriad of techniques thatcircumvent DBE participation goals and render the program without substance.Third DBE program administrators across the country deviate from the intent andletter of Part 26‰ЫЄs certification procedures and form. Part 26 creates anarrowly-tailored certification process that requires use of a specific form.However most recipients claim that others‰ЫЄ certification process is sodeficient that they require the DBE to ‰ЫПre-apply‰Ыќ by submitting an entirely newapplication. Recognition of Part 26‰ЫЄs focus on uniformity of process and onassistance to the DBE is obliterated by the failure of every single recipient tooffer certification via reciprocity. Fourth DOT Civil Rights Regional offices have not published nor implemented anoversight policy or program that specifically regulates the DBE programs of thehundreds of Non-Primary Recipients of federal transportation monies. TheseNon-Primary Recipients are often municipalities or regional transportationbodies that are also required to comply with Part 26. However the largemajority of these recipients that I have encountered fail the requirements andthe objectives of Part 26 in any number of ways. Further it is extremelydifficult to find the recipients‰ЫЄ DBE program material or officers‰ЫЄ contactinformation and the intent of Part 26 is often subverted into serving therecipient‰ЫЄs unique agenda. Thus Part 26 is rendered without substance in alarge number of areas throughout the country.To address these concerns please consider the following broadly describedchanges to the administration of Part 26:1)Adjust administrative emphases to better encompass all stated objectives ofthe programs giving more balanced attention to the objectives of;a) ensuring ‰ЫПnondiscrimination in the award and administration of                                  DOT- assisted contracts‰Ыќ(е¤26.1(a)); b) creating ‰ЫПa level playing field on which DBEs can compete fairly for                                 DOT-assisted contracts‰Ыќ (е¤26.1(b)); andc) removing ‰ЫПbarriers to the participation of DBEs in DOT-assisted                                            contracts‰Ыќ(е¤26.1(e)).2)realize and incorporate a thorough understanding of actual competitivepractices into DBE programs‰ЫЄ enforcement and monitoring procedures;3)Require all recipients to honor another recipient‰ЫЄs certification‰ЫУi.e. forall DBEs that were properly certified by their home-state presume certificationvia reciprocity is the appropriate path for certification by all otherrecipients or DBE programs; and4)       Implement a comprehensive and public auditing program regarding Non-PrimaryRecipients‰ЫЄ DBE programs (such as those required of municipalities and regionaltransportation organizations) and make information gleaned from the auditsavailable to all DBEs and DBE program administrators throughout the country.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion my experience with Part 26 leads me to conclude that oversight ofthis program must occur under the philosophy that the program‰ЫЄs ultimateobjective is not to define the players or to effect the people but to effectthe process.Thank you for your consideration of my comments.

I support  the appeal of sections 382.117(e)  and  382.27(c)(8)  of the May 2008 Final Rule of the ACA Act which  places advance notification and documentation standards on the users of PSD but do not support such an appeal in referene to ESAs/comfort animals.2. The above sections clearly violate existing Federal law and standards by discriminating against handlers with PSD. With reference to PSD and  PSD's only I suggest the elimination of the Advance Notification and Documentation requirements for handlers of psychiatric service animals.3. I share the department's concern re fraud and abuse of service dog access since such abuse could impact on access policies and availability.  However the department has shown neither empirical or ancedotal evidence that abuse exists and is of such a magnitude it would require such ononerous limitation on the rights of the disabled.  I  realize that air travel does bring with it additional concerns of safety and in these days security that is not usually presented in access issues. Still there should be at a minimum a showing of substantial substantive evidence that unusual restrictions are necessary and would accomplish the desired result.DOT has not shown the need for the discrimination they have put in place or the need for Fraud detection they are requesting and until they do so there is no rationale for developing these policies.  I join in the recommendation that DOT do a five year study on the issue of the existence and frequency of fraud and abuse related to service dog access. DOT could require the airlines to collect statistics about   ( 1 ) the number of assistance dogs traveling and ( 2 ) what percentage presented problems and ( 3 )what percentage was documented as fraud or (4 ) attempted fraud or ( 5 ) suspected fraud.

A decorated combat veteran being treated for PTSD with the help of a psychiatric service dog is denied permission to fly to visit a dying family member because of their service dog. This veteran decides to leave the dog behind due to the time constraints. Later this same veteran suffers a serious episode that endangers their life or the life of someone else. This story is most likely to make the news on some show such as 60 Minutes or 20/20. It will probably make the news around the same time some other unfortunate incident occurs because someone decided to ""sneak"" their dog onto a flight by pretending is a service dog for those suffering from some other ""invisible"" condition that is not psychiatric in nature. People will start asking who setup the rules so that they are ineffective and life threatening at the same time. Other people making use of service dogs are not required to meet this new rule only those afflicted with psychiatric disorders such as depression or bipolar syndrome? Why would this rule only apply to those people and not others such as someone making use of a service dog for someone suffering from epileptic seizures or diabetes? Are psychiatric service dogs more susceptible to fraudulent behavior than other types of service dogs? How does this regulation stop potential fraud? Is someone who would be willing to commit this type of fraud going to be deterred because they cannot feign being crazy? These same hucksters will suddenly be stopped because everyone knows that crazy people are okay but you don't want anyone to think you're diabetic or epileptic or blind or deaf or whatever other conditions may apply?This rule is completely ineffective and a major hindrance in the lives of many people. Some of these may be potentially life threatening in nature. It discriminates against an entire group of people; it discriminates against those suffering from psychiatric disorders. If it does not violate the actual words of The American With Disabilities Act it surely violates the principles upon which the law was originally created. This will definitely lead to lawsuits. Lawsuits that are going to cost the government lots of money to fight. These are also lawsuits that will in all probability will be lost by the government. Finally why was this regulation originally created? The reasoning that it is to prevent fraud and abuse does not make sense. What is to prevent the same huckster from not claiming some other disability. This rule applied to all service dogs would at least make sense from this perspective. Was it originally meant to apply to all service dogs but the bureaucracy felt it couldn't counter all the lawsuits that would be generated if applied in this manner? Was it made because someone confused ‰ЫПemotional support dogs‰Ыќ with ‰ЫПpsychiatric service dogs‰Ыќ? All pets are ‰ЫПemotional support dogs‰Ыќ. A service dog is something altogether different.

What may concern America‰ЫЄs Veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan diagnosed with PTSD or other invisible wounds of war is that DOT's new rules [Sections J82.1J 7(e) & 382.27(c)(8)] violate the legislative intent of the law (49 U.S.C. 41705) which provides that no air carrier may discriminate against any otherwise qualified individual with a disability by reason of such disability in the provision of air transportation. I believe that the revised regulations governing Psychiatric Service Animals unfairly discriminates against people with psychiatric disabilities. Most psychiatric disabilities including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are by nature a hidden disability unlike more apparent physical disabilities that can be seen with the naked eye. The requirements spelled out in Section 382.117(e) are discriminatory for people with hidden disabilities versus people with physical disabilities thereby treating one class of disabled passengers differently than other classes of disabled passengers as well as their nondisabled counterparts. The requirement also imposes on passengers with psychiatric disabilities new time restrictions added expenses and potentially embarrassing situations with airport and airline staff that forces them to reveal the nature of their hidden disability - which also raises significant privacy concerns. The DOT requirements should also have input from the various airlines that have to implement these rules because the end result will most certainly be legal litigation aimed at the Airline Industry and DOT. Furthermore since no data exists to document that a problem exists whereby passengers without disabilities are trying to ""pass off pets as service animals DOT's requirement is punishing the very passengers that it is intended to protect under the law. It appears that the more prudent approach would involve DOT working with input from the airlines - and advocacy groups - on data collection to ascertain whether widespread misuse and violations of the protections by non-disabled passengers exists before imposing an added barrier to passengers needing Psychiatric Service Animals.",DOT-OST-2009-0093,Psychiatric Service Dog Society - Petition for Rulemaking - Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel ,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2009-0093-0127,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Veterans Today News Network,2009-12-09T00:00:00-05:00,Robert Hanafin,Robert Leroy Hanafin,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It would discriminate against those with psychiatric disabilities.  Psychiatric dogs are used by Veterans with PTSD autistic children and those struggling with mood disorders. Besides blatant bias and disregard for someone's private life there are other questions that need to be answered.  How will the information be protected?  Are the airlines and DOT ready to handle that VERY private information?  Will they be liable if that information is leaked? Why are we putting the onus on people struggling with disabilities?  The responsibility should be on how dogs are registered.  If I did have a registered psychiatric dog who in the airlines should have a right to question my doctor?If a dog is registered as a Service Dog it is a Service Dog- period.  If there is a problem with how dogs are registered then solve the problem there not with DOT.  This is a case of 'mental profiling'.  Let's take a realistic view: we do not allow for racial or religious profiling yet we can show data on terrorist attacks and crime rates based on both.  I don't see any data based on the abuse of a service animal (only the anticipation thereof).  If we are questioning the validity of a service dog should we also question the validity of prescriptions by doctors?  There is so much flawed thinking in this regulation I hope the ACLU and the ADA comes on board.  I suspect this will end up in a lawsuit based on the obvious discrimination.  How do you prove someone with epilepsy really has what they say?  Should they show a 'doctor's note'? And when did DOT and the airlines become the disability police? In our American system we do not (and should not) infringe on the rights of those with legitimate disabilities to stop some from abusing the system.Someone please contact me and explain how this does not discriminate against someone who served our country and now has a psychiatric disability.,DOT-OST-2009-0093,Psychiatric Service Dog Society - Petition for Rulemaking - Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel ,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2009-0093-0180,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2009-12-16T00:00:00-05:00,Greg Zima,Greg N.

The problem with ""prescribed pets"" or emotional support dogs has become rampant as well as abuse by the general public who simply wishes to travel with their pet and/or avoid fees.  My service dog was trained by a nationally known organization. She is quite valuable monetarily due to the training she has had as well as being invaluable to me. I run the risk quite often of her being exposed to untrained pets who are in public being misrepresented as service dogs.

Or even a person suffering from a heart condition. Should those persons be required to be drug free and not have medication available on the flight? The right of a person to be accompanied by a service animal must be applied equally and can not be restricted to just the visible disability. That right to be accompanied by a service animal must be applied equally to all persons with a disability. Failure to provide equal treatment results in a discrimination and will result in much litigation in the Courts.I would urge the Department of Transportation to restrict their rules to that which provides equal treatment under the law.

With my service dog I am far less likely to cause a problem on the plane than the person seated next to me. My service dog is trained to mitigate a disability not keep me company. My disability is covered under the ADA just like an individual who is blind Deaf or has seizures; so is my right to use a service dog to assist me.

I believe this to be unconscionable not only for the civilians who use these trained dogs but for our military with PSTD for whom these task trained dogs have broadened life and made life much easier. Several years ago I was denied the usage of a small service dog in a coop which became Grad V. Royalwood  in the Federal Court System and with the help of MPAS and the DOJ I won the suit. It states in the story that I am bipolar which while that is true I am bipolar 2 the lesser of two degrees. The problem which significantly impacts my life is my PTSD.Unfortunately there are many who do not wish to recognize this vital service dog. It is so important that we get this policy changed. Let's end the discrimination of PSD's now both with the DOT and IRS. IRS only allows medical deductions for those service dogs for individuals with physical problems: guide seizure deaf etc.... The opposition states that fraud will be perpetrated is devoid of these facts. There is no other service dog including those with invisible disabilities that is required to have documentation from the treating doctor in this case the psychiatrist and a 48 hr time lag from purchase to boarding. I am almost 60 and remember how badly we treated our Vets in Nam. Do not let this war continue devoid of the help that a PSD can give a veteran with severe PTSD.An ESA is NOT the SAME as a PSD and should need verification.

We suggest that each respective FHWA State Division Office be given the authority to approve or disapprove this submission by the state.  Because it will be important for States to receive approval of their plans as quickly as possible in order to implement any changes etc. this approval process should be at the local level in order to allow for quick implementation and correction.  Clarification of 3 year Annual Goal Submission ‰ЫТ The proposed rule suggests allowing recipients the ability to provide a year-to-year projection of its likely DBE participation within the framework of a goal and methodology submitted only every three years.  The proposed rule suggests that this flexibility is more relevant for FAA programs because of the likelihood of federal funding fluctuations.  We suggest that the Department allow Recipients to choose one or the other process for benchmarking.  Choosing either a three-year overall goal number with appropriate accountability processes as described in Section 26.47(c) or a year-to-year projection as described here would give the industry a clear understanding of how the State DOT Transit Agency or Airport Authority will be setting their goals.  Changing mid-stream in the process could make reporting very difficult and defeat the purpose of lessening the burden of setting annual goals each year. Personal Net Worth ‰ЫТ The proposed rule increasing the PNW cap to $1.3 million explains that this change ‰ЫПdoes not represent an increase in actual personal worth‰Ыќ because the ‰ЫПinflationary adjustment simply maintains the economic status quo.‰Ыќ  In Colorado and other western states with similar economies and ‰ЫПcost of living‰Ыќ levels an individual with a $1.3 million personal net worth may not necessarily be considered economically disadvantaged.  Unfortunately a ‰ЫПone-size-fits-all‰Ыќ solution will help DBEs in some regions and hurt DBEs in states like Colorado.  Because of the economic downturn Colorado‰ЫЄs DBEs have been hurt severely and are have more difficulty obtaining financing insurance and bonding.  Large construction companies (including larger and stronger DBEs) are bidding on all projects large and small.  Because of their size these larger firms have the ability to under-bid our smaller DBE firms.  This PNW increase will allow financially strong DBEs to remain in the program thus preventing newer and smaller DBEs from growth.The proposed rule should not be an across the board change.  The increased PNW to $1.3 million may be very appropriate for concessions (ACDBEs) since those businesses are capital intensive and have higher cash flow requirements.  Many ACDBEs have to build out their concession space and require bank financing.  In today‰ЫЄs lending environment a lender will require higher asset levels and in fact some are franchises and franchisors often require higher net worths to operate a franchise.  We strongly encourage USDOT to adopt the higher PNW threshold in Part 23 only not in Part 26.  We do not believe a one-size-fits-all standard that suits Part 23 should be applied to Part 26.Some changes that could offset this trend may include proposing a time limit for participation in the DBE program.  An additional change would be to allow states the flexibility to set ‰ЫПtiered‰Ыќ DBE project goals that would allow smaller DBEs to bid against similarly situated companies.  Without implementing changes to other parts of the regulation this PNW increase will penalize small and new DBE firms.The proposal to remove retirement savings from the PNW calculation will in our opinion also benefit the wealthier DBEs and decrease the number of graduations because of personal net worth.  Based on Colorado‰ЫЄs experience family owned businesses (especially those that are woman owned) are more likely to have these types of retirement accounts and use them already to limit their tax liability.  If there is a demographic study done we believe that the majority of individuals that would benefit from this would be non-minority individuals.  One of the arguments in favor of removing retirement savings from the PNW calculation is that they cannot be drawn on.  We disagree with this assertion.  Many can be drawn upon though at a penalty but they can be drawn upon.  In addition they can be borrowed against.  We believe that the consequence of adopting both a higher threshold and removing more assets from consideration means that almost anyone will be considered economically disadvantaged.  In Adarand the Supreme Court found Program eligibility as it was at the time to be both over-inclusive and under-inclusive.  We believe that the proposed adjustments move eligibility back in the direction of being over-inclusive.  By doing so we believe the door will open wider to further Constitutional challenges on the basis that the Program is not narrowly tailored. To monitor potential abuse of this proposal we recommend a requirement that DBEs provide an annual statement identifying changes in their contributions to the accounts during the past year.  A review by certification staff could identify whether individuals and companies were sheltering their assets for the purpose of remaining within the PNW cap.Interstate Certification and Related Issues ‰ЫТNPRM outlines 3 possible approaches:‰ЫўLeave things as they are now firms must apply in each state states are allowed the freedom to reach their own conclusions regarding eligibility may enter into their own regional reciprocity agreements;‰ЫўFederalize certification central directory;‰ЫўInterstate reciprocity‰Ыў‰ЫПPresumptively certified‰Ыќ‰ЫўState B must certify within 30 days unless it had good cause to object‰ЫўLocal appeal must be providedOf the 3 approaches it is the opinion of COUCP that the NPRM favors the one with the least appeal.  COUCP is sympathetic to desire to reduce the burden of firms seeking certification in multiple states.  However that is only one of several concerns and certainly not the most important.  COUCP strongly believes that the paramount concern should always remain the integrity of the Program.  We further believe that of the 3 approaches identified the NPRM favors the one which weakens the Program the most.  Of the 3 approaches COUCP strongly favors leaving the process for certifying out-of-state firms with the individual states.  If the resource problem could be resolved COUCP would be in favor of Federalizing or centralizing the process.  We do not favor interstate reciprocity as proposed.  Our reasoning follows.ProcessThe NPRM acknowledges that there currently exists across the country widely divergent processes interpretations experience and expertise.  The most glaring example of the lack of uniformity of processes can be found in the manner in which on-site interviews are conducted.  Many on-site transcripts we have obtained from home states have little to no practical value in determining a firm‰ЫЄs eligibility.  The Regulation currently requires that all recipients use the same application form and that before a certification decision is rendered an on-site visit be conducted or a transcript obtained from the home state.  COUCP believes that the next logical step before mandating interstate reciprocity is to move toward standardizing the process by first mandating the use of a uniform on-site questionnaire.  Some will counter by saying that circumstances are always different and they don‰ЫЄt want to be bound to a document that may not take into account those differences.  To that we respond that a uniform questionnaire can always be supplemented to fit the circumstances.  Once that has been accomplished the remainder of the process should be standardized. Burden of ProofThe NPRM proposes shifting the burden of proof when processing applications of out-of-state firms from the applicant to the recipient.  At the same time recipients would be required to render decisions within 30 days and would be required to provide the applicant with a local hearing when it proposes to deny certification.  We believe that these proposals have numerous unintended consequences.‰ЫўBurden of proof ‰ЫТ We believe that the shifting of the burden of proof effectively holds in-state applicants to a higher standard that is inherently unfair to them.  Currently applicant firms must be operational.  One aspect of ‰ЫПoperational‰Ыќ is that they have met the legal requirements to do business such as registering with the Secretary of State if a corporation etc. or obtaining the proper license if engaged in an industry (e.g. engineering) requiring one.  If we must go through what amounts to a revocation process for out-of-state firms that have not met the legal requirements to do business we argue that we would be in effect holding in-state applicants to a higher standard.  We strongly disagree with having disparate burdens of proof depending on whether an applicant is in the state or out.‰Ыў30 days to render decision ‰ЫТ The effect of this requirement is that out-of-state applications will be expedited at the expense of in-state applications.  This is inherently unfair to in-state applicants.‰ЫўLocal appeal of denial decisions ‰ЫТ Places an increased burden on states to disprove a certification granted by another state that may have been flawed in the first place.  Also this requirement appears at odds with USDOT‰ЫЄs stated desire that denials of all new applications be appealed directly to USDOT not appealed locally.Other considerations‰ЫўThe NPRM references a requirement to enter data into and research a national database prior to rendering certification decisions.  We believe this requirement amounts to an unfunded mandate that it could require a full-time person to implement and that these are resources we simply do not have at the present time.‰ЫўIf an out-of-state firm is presumptively certified should it not follow that firms who lose their home-state certification be immediately decertified in other states?  If so the administrative burden to continually check the home-state status of out-of-state firms is immense.The NPRM acknowledges the difficulties with this proposal.  We agree with the Department‰ЫЄs observation that moving to nationwide reciprocity at this time is premature.

This change to 49 CFR Part 26 would be welcome.The current low PNW threshold often drives the disadvantaged owners of DBE firms to make economic decisions based on DBE status retention rather than other more conventional market drivers.  For example the exclusion of the business firm itself from the PNW calculation results in some DBE owners causing value to accumulate within the business rather than distributing it to the owners.  This can result in accumulated earnings tax issues increases in litigation exposure and so forth.I also support the exclusion of qualified retirement accounts from the calculation of the PNW cap.  Funds in qualified retirement accounts while perhaps liquid are not easily liquidated and available for the use of the DBE business without tax penalties.  For this reason exclusion from the calculation is warranted.Finally I also endorse an additional rule change that would cause the PNW cap to be revisited every year and adjusted based upon the CPI-U.  At a minimum this should be done every few years ‰ЫТ not every twenty.Thank you for considering these views.,DOT-OST-2010-0118,Disadvantaged Business Enterprise: Program Improvements,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2010-0118-0087,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2010-07-09T00:00:00-04:00,William Cotter,William J.

We are writing to support certain aspects of the proposed rulemaking that would amend 49 CFR Part 26 (Docket No. OST-2010-0118).In particular we strongly support the proposed adjustment to the personal net worth (PNW) test under consideration that would revise the PNW cap from $750000 to $1.31 million (49 CFR 26.67).  We have found that the unadjusted PNW cap has driven some of our clients to make economic decisions that are not always in the best interests of the DBE firm or in the best interests of the qualifying DBE owner.   For example historically the value of the DBE firm itself and the personal residence of the qualifying DBE owner have been excluded from the PNW calculation.   We are aware that in order to continue to meet the unrealistically low PNW cap some DBE firms have built up value within the DBE firm itself instead of distributing that wealth to the qualifying DBE owner because that wealth would be ‰ЫПcharged against‰Ыќ his or her PNW cap.  Often this accumulation of value within a DBE firm leaves the firm vulnerable to other problems such as accumulated earnings tax being targeted for litigation and so forth.Similarly we are aware of qualifying DBE owners who have acquired personal residences of more significant value that they might otherwise have acquired ‰ЫТ simply because its value would not be ‰ЫПcharged against‰Ыќ the PNW calculation.In short we see the low PNW cap as influencing DBE firms and their owners to make economic decisions based on typical market factors rather than being driven by an artificially low PNW cap.We also endorse  the exclusion from the PNW calculation of the qualifying DBE owner‰ЫЄs qualified retirement accounts such 401k accounts individual retirement accounts (IRAs) Roth IRAs Keough plans SEP plans and similar tax deferred accounts.

As proposed there is no opportunity for a Recipient to document Good Faith Effort (GFE) in any given year of the three-year Overall Goal.  The USDOT is using language in this section such as ‰ЫПmust‰Ыќ and ‰ЫПrequired‰Ыќ.  Therefore since the Recipient has to achieve the Overall Goal each year or take corrective actions to achieve the Overall Goal the following year the Overall Goal will become an Overall Set-Aside.  This runs counter to the narrowly-tailored nature of the DBE Program.  I do not agree with this approach.Goal Submission‰ЫўThe USDOT proposes to make the Recipient responsible for ‰ЫПgood faith implementation‰Ыќ of the Overall Goal in each of the three years.  However by requiring the Recipient to meet the Overall Goal or take corrective actions to meet the Overall Goal the next year the Overall Goal has become an Overall Set-Aside and the Recipient is not able to show good faith implementation efforts.  See previous comment.Improving Oversight‰ЫўI agree with the USDOT‰ЫЄs attempt to strengthen the Recipient‰ЫЄs responsibility to perform CUF reviews;‰ЫўI do not agree with the USDOT‰ЫЄs proposal to not strengthen the language regarding the DBELO having direct and independent access to the CEO.  DOTs interpret that requirement in their own way and leave to the Division Office to disprove their statement that the DBELO has direct and independent access to the CEO.  The explanation provided on page #25817 defining direct and independent access as ‰ЫПthe DBELO must not be required to get anyone‰ЫЄs consent or sign-off or ‰Ычgo through channels‰ЫЄ to talk and write personally to the CEO about DBE program matters‰Ыќ is much more specific and would be a helpful addition to the regulation; and‰ЫўI do not agree with the USDOT‰ЫЄs proposal to not strengthen the language regarding the Recipient be adequately staffed to administer the DBE Program.  During good economic conditions Recipients tend to add the DBELO responsibility as a collateral responsibility to an employee.  During economic stringency there is an even greater push by the Recipient to reduce even further the resource allocation for the implementation of the DBE Program.  As the DBELO the incumbent is responsible for the following: either performing DBE Certification and/or ensuring that it is being implemented effectively (including preparing Appeal responses for applicants that have appealed the decision to the USDOT) implementing or monitoring the effective implementation of a DBE Business Development Program conducting shortfall analyses in the pre- and post-award situations (for Recipients that set Contract Goals) developing the Overall Goal (and for Recipients that have Public Transportation and Aviation under the Recipient the DBELO will be responsible for three Overall Goal-setting efforts) data collection and analysis to develop the Uniform Reporting Forms ensuring the Recipient/Municipality is conducting CUF reviews or conducting the CUF reviews personally mediating prompt payment disputes between DBE firms and prime contractors and informing the CEO of issues on a periodic basis.  This would be a daunting task for one person let alone a person that has the DBELO function as a collateral duty.  The language needs to be strengthened to indicate that at a minimum the DBELO should be a dedicated position and not added to another position.  Additionally adequate staffing needs to be further defined to allow for DBELOs that have FTA and FAA responsibilities as well (i.e. one DBELO for each modal agency).Personal Net Worth‰ЫўI do not agree with the USDOT‰ЫЄs proposal to utilize the CPI to adjust the PNW cap for inflation.  A 73% adjustment will work to markedly increase the number of applicants to the DBE Program.  It is true that the cap was set based upon 1989 numbers but the practical application through the continued deduction of the applicant-owner‰ЫЄs primary residence and interest in the business serves to reinforce that the $750000 cap is an effective cap to maintain.  If the USDOT is going to adjust the PNW cap no matter what why not use the $1000000 cap offered under the previous FAA (49 CFR Part 23) DBE Program.  This will serve to increase the PNW cap and almost split the difference; and‰ЫўPNW & Retirement Savings: Applicants presently use shelters creatively to allocate assets.  To simplify Recipients‰ЫЄ applications evaluations all Retirement Savings plans should be counted as assets.  This will eliminate the need to exempt certain plans and will work to address applicants inappropriately sheltering assets to exclude them from PNW consideration.Interstate Certification and Related Issues‰ЫўThe proposed Rebuttable Presumption Reciprocity System will have the practical impact of flooding the DBE Programs with applications and will serve to dilute the work that is available to presently certified DBE firms.  As long as a firm is certified in one State this will enable the DBE firm to now apply to 49 remaining States and DC and Puerto Rico.  If a State presently has 350 firms certified (for example) and only 100 firms perform the work contracted to DBEs this situation will deteriorate exponentially under this construct.  If prime contractors generally contract with the same DBEs presently they will not be looking to gamble on unknown out-of-State firms that have been certified under this proposal (especially in a poor economy).  Additionally the opportunity for fraud will exponentially increase because the Recipient will find it much simpler to either certify the applicants or not to respond at all (which under this proposal means that the applicant is certified).  Also the State UCPs will not free up resources presently allocated to DBE Certification but will most likely need to increase personnel resources to accommodate the increased administrative burden.  The reality of the situation is this: There are varied approaches to Certification and how the regulations are applied depends upon the education and experience of a given Certification Specialist.  Compound this with the fact that numerous Recipients have housed the DBE Certification process in their State Small Business Set-Aside Offices.  This means that employees steeped in the State Set-Aside Program processes are responsible for DBE Program certification.  If one were to add all these considerations together the opportunities for the certification of fraudulent firms will greatly increase.  I do not agree with the USDOT‰ЫЄs proposal and propose that the best approach is an aggressive educational/instructional effort through the USDOT modal agencies to educate the State UCP Certification Specialists.Fostering Small Business Participation‰ЫўThe Small Business Element proposal does not even reference the DBE Business Development Program construct as defined in Appendix C to 49 CFR Part 26.  This proposal should be linked to the DBE Business Development Program in some way.  Regarding the number of strategies as long as the present list is neither exhaustive nor mandatory it is a good start to offer possible approaches.  As for the amount of time necessary for Recipients to amend their DBE Program documents the amount of time should reflect the efforts needed by Recipients that have not developed any of the strategies listed or others not listed.  Therefore allowing Recipients one year to implement a Small Business Element should be sufficient time;‰ЫўThe DBE Workshop Approach (using the Missouri and Wisconsin models as examples) has merit.  However FHWA is presently performing five DBE Workshops this calendar year and my understanding is that a White Paper will be developed based upon input from the Recipients that are hosting the DBE Workshops.  It may be more beneficial to wait until after the DBE Workshops have been held and to incorporate the Best Practices generated through the DBE Workshops into an overall suggested approach that will be left up to the Recipients as to how to incorporate any/all of the DBE Workshop elements into their routine federal-aid Construction Project processes;‰ЫўRegarding discriminatory or excessive Bonding Practices prime contractors should treat non-DBE as well as DBE Subcontractors the same when it comes to Bonding Practices.Terminations and Substitutions of DBE Subcontractors‰ЫўThe Listing of Good Causes for a prime contractor to request formal termination of a DBE Subcontractor is adequate.  However it appears that either the List is missing number (ii) or the items are inaccurately numbered following number (i).  Additionally number (iv) may need further definition as it is open-ended.  This item should be tied to items identified in the Subcontract agreement.Counting Issue‰ЫўI agree that items supplied by the prime contractor should not be counted towards the Contract Goal.  However there is a more important issue that needs to be addressed.  Under 49 CFR 26.55 this regulation clearly defines a DBE firm‰ЫЄs role as a subcontractor to not only install materials but to also furnish the materials to be installed.  In 2006 an FHWA Memorandum directed Recipients that joint-check situations are acceptable only after the Recipient has previously formally approved the joint-check situation.  In the absence of a joint-check situation if a DBE firm does not furnish and install the materials the only commercially-useful-function that the DBE firm is performing is that of a Broker of labor services.  The eligibility in the case of a Broker is the percentage equivalent to the administrative fees.  There is definitely a disagreement regarding this situation amongst the States (federal and State) and it would be greatly beneficial to have clarification from the USDOT.Application and PNW Forms‰ЫўIf the USDOT in whole or in part adopts the Interstate Certification process there will need to be clarification as to what forms are acceptable.Certification-Related Provisions‰ЫўI agree with the USDOT‰ЫЄs proposal to expand upon the DBE applicant‰ЫЄs responsibility to supply detailed information for the UCP to assign an appropriate NAICS Code and with the charge to present up-to-date information;‰ЫўWhile I agree with most of the USDOT statements made in this section I do not agree that an applicant should be allowed to not have an inventory and warehouse if it is applying as a Supplier or that an applicant should not be required to have equipment either owned by the applicant or long-term leased from a firm other than the prime contractor as a measure of DBE eligibility.  If a firm is applying as a Broker then a telephone computer and Office space rented (or at home) may be sufficient.  In the case of applicants for Suppliers and Contractors there does need to be a minimum amount of expectations that an applicant is expected to realize.  This section needs to be revised accordingly.  Additionally this is the first time that I have heard from the USDOT that the DBE Program serves as ‰ЫПan incubator for start-up businesses‰Ыќ.  The only mention presently of business development in 49 CFR Part 26 is in Appendix C.  If the USDOT is transitioning the DBE Program to a USSBA-type business program there will need to be a great deal more focus by Recipients on implementing Appendix C and a much greater level of funding will need to be provided either by Recipients or FHWA (and especially FTA and FAA) to make this a reality;‰ЫўThe proposed acceptable lifespan of an On-Site Report (three to five years) is of concern.  During the review/approval process for UCPs approximately seven years ago I was informed by the USDOT that the lifespan of an On-Site Report was approximately seven to nine years.  Now I understand that the USDOT has revised the lifespan downward by four years.  While I agree that On-Site Reports need to be updated periodically this downward adjustment has effectively halved the lifespan and will have a significant resource impact (especially if the Interstate Certification construct is in any way implemented) on Recipients.  I agree that On-Site Reports need to be updated but that the interval should be every five to seven years and not every three to five years.  Regarding use of Videoconferencing or other technologies these media do not replace the actual On-Site visual inspection necessary to confirm that an applicant has an Office/Business Site inventory sufficient equipment etc.  The actual interview may be conducted via other media but the visual On-Site inspection cannot be replaced and will need to be performed by the Home State Recipient.

If recipients are being held accountable for achieving goals on awards and commitments and not on actual achievements the questions must be asked; are we are truly leveling the playing field or just encouraging race conscious goals over race neutral goals.  This change if enacted will serve to convert the overall goal to an overall Set-Aside basically doing away with the race neutral part of the DBE program and possibly opening the program to further legal challenges.  This runs counter to the narrowly-tailored nature of the DBE Program.  As proposed there is no opportunity for a Recipient to document Good Faith Effort (GFE) in any given year of the three-year overall goal.  The USDOT is using language in this section such as ‰ЫПmust‰Ыќ and ‰ЫПrequired‰Ыќ is reflective of a set-aside program and not a goal program.  Since the Recipient has to achieve the overall goal each year or take corrective actions to achieve the Overall Goal the following year the overall goal will become an Overall Set-Aside.  As proposed recipients will not be encouraged to find innovative avenues to truly level the playing field but efforts will be solely focused upon setting project goals on projects whether or not they are achievable to satisfy the accountability requirements of the regulations.   We do not agree with this approach.‰ЫўIn lieu of the proposed.   If a recipient fails to achieve their overall goal   they could develop an internal work plan for their agency to increase DBE participation.  This plan should include a section for ‰ЫПinnovative approaches to level the playing field‰Ыќ.  The work plan should also require the recipient to review the overall goal to see if adjustments are necessary if it is determined that the goal needs to be adjusted the recipient would submit the revised goal along with the justification to the appropriate DOT agency.  If at the end of FY3 the recipient fails to achieve the overall goal they would submit copies of their work plans and progress towards goal achievement.   Goal Submission‰ЫўThe USDOT proposes to make the Recipient responsible for ‰ЫПgood faith implementation‰Ыќ of the Overall Goal in each of the three years.  If a recipient fails to achieve their overall goal they would develop an internal work plan for their agency to increase DBE participation.  This plan should include a section for ‰ЫПinnovative approaches to level the playing field‰Ыќ.  The work plan should also require the recipient to review the overall goal to see if adjustments are necessary.   If it is determined that the goal needs to be adjusted the recipient would submit the revised goal along with the justification to the appropriate DOT agency.  If at the end of FY3 the recipient fails to achieve the overall goal they would submit copies of their work plans and outline their progress towards goal achievement.   Improving Oversight‰ЫўWe agree with the DOT‰ЫЄs attempt to strengthen the Recipient‰ЫЄs responsibility to perform CUF reviews;‰ЫўThe language regarding the Recipient having adequate staff to administer the DBE Program needs to be more clearly defined.  To administer the program in accordance with the regulations and the spirit in which the program was developed requires appropriate resources.  Unfortunately the administration of the DBE Program is not always viewed as an economic development program or a requirement for DOT funding but is viewed as an auxiliary or social services program.  When resources are allocated many times these programs receive minimal or no resources.  If these programs are going to accomplish what they were created to achieve and have any permanent impact adequate resources must be allocated.  ‰ЫўThese programs can be greatly impacted by a Recipient‰ЫЄs change in CEOs.  While the regulations may not change the CEOs view of the importance of the program may. These types of fluctuations could have a significant impact on a recipients program.  Therefore it is extremely important that the regulations be clear and that new executive staff be required to have training.  This training would be best provided by DOT personnel and should clarify the required roles and responsibilities of the CEO and the DBELO.  It is important that people who have the ability to make decisions that will impact the program understand the intent of the program and its requirements. Personal Net Worth‰ЫўA 73% adjustment will work to markedly increase the number of applicants to the DBE Program.  It is true that the cap was set based upon 1989 numbers but the practical application through the continued deduction of the applicant-owner‰ЫЄs primary residence and interest in the business serves to reinforce that the $750000 cap is an effective cap to maintain.  If the USDOT is going to adjust the PNW cap why not use the $1000000 cap offered under the previous FAA (49 CFR Part 23) DBE Program.  This will serve to increase the PNW cap and almost split the difference; and‰ЫўPNW & Retirement Savings: Applicants presently use shelters most often through the establishment of Trusts to creatively allocate assets.  To simplify application evaluations all retirement savings plans should be counted as assets.  This will eliminate the need to exempt certain plans and will work to address applicants inappropriately sheltering assets to exclude them from PNW consideration.  ‰ЫўWe do not agree with using CPI as the adjustment vehicle as this does not provide for the disparity in wealth between the presumed groups and non-presumed groups.  We would recommend that DOT perform an analysis of the PNW for firms currently certified in the program and conduct a study to determine the impact of raising the PNW particularly as it relates to start-up businesses.  We have only had two firms over the last two years who have become ineligible for certification due to exceeding the PNW requirements of the DBE program.  Additionally we have observed a disparity in the PNW between certain presumed groups within the DBE program which may be further impacted by this change.Interstate Certification and Related Issues‰ЫўThe proposed Rebuttable Presumption Reciprocity System will have the practical impact of flooding the DBE Programs with applications.  As long as a firm is certified in one State this will enable the DBE firm to now apply to 49 remaining States and DC and Puerto Rico.  If a State presently has 350 firms certified (for example) this number could expand exponentially skewing the Overall Goals.  ‰ЫўThe opportunity for fraud will increase because the Recipient will find it much simpler to either certify the applicants or not to respond at all (which under this proposal means that the applicant is certified).  The increase in administrative time to hold ineligibility meetings will become extremely burdensome to states.  It should be noted that not all UCPs hold firms seeking certification to all of the regulatory requirements.  There are varied approaches to certification and how the regulations are applied depends upon the education and experience of a given certification specialist.   The change in process will not free up resources presently allocated to DBE certification but will most likely need to increase the need for personnel resources to accommodate the increased administrative burden.    If one were to add all these considerations together the opportunities for the certification of fraudulent firms will greatly increase.  Currently we are experiencing a larger number of firms set up to take advantage of program that do not meet the criteria for certification.   ‰ЫўDBE firms should bear the burden of proof in these eligibility proceedings.‰ЫўThe time period is not acceptable.  With current staffing levels it would be almost impossible to review home-state applications and out-of-state applications within the prescribed time-lines.  This will certainly create pressure on states and diminish the integrity of the certification process.  Firms are not always forthcoming with information that may bring question to their eligibility.  A thorough review of an application must be made to insure that only firms that should benefit from the program benefit.  Currently some communities are concerned about the lack of opportunities that they have received under this program.  The proposed changes could make this more of an issue as firms that are not socially and economically disadvantaged could be become certified through default and further dilute the opportunities available to those firms who should benefit from the program. ‰ЫўThese changes will also impact the overall goals with the influx of applications as many firms will seek to be certified in all states regardless as to whether they plan to perform work in the state or not.   If DOT implements this proposed change a recommendation should be made that the national goal be reinstituted as the current overall goal setting process may become invalid and the availability numbers may become skewed.  ‰ЫўFirms that appeal a state‰ЫЄs decision to deny or remove certification to DOT should lose certification under each UCP under which they are certified; if DOT upholds the state‰ЫЄs decision to deny or remove eligibility under size ownership control or social and economic disadvantage. Fostering Small Business ParticipationWhat we have heard from the DBE community is that some prime contractors will require bonding as a tool to negotiate contract disputes.  Rather the negotiating with the DBE firm to resolve contract disputes the prime will go after the bond; affecting the DBE firm‰ЫЄs ability to obtain future bonding and credit.  We are not sure how common the practice has become. Terminations and Substitutions of DBE SubcontractorsNo commentsCounting IssueWe agree with the current regulation.Application and PNW Forms‰ЫўIf the USDOT in whole or in part adopts the Interstate Certification process there will need to be clarification as to what forms are acceptable and which forms will need to be updated.   Certification-Related Provisions‰ЫўWe agree with the DOT‰ЫЄs proposal to expand upon the DBE applicant‰ЫЄs responsibility to supply detailed information for the UCP to assign an appropriate NAICS Code and with the responsibility to present up-to-date information;‰ЫўWhile in the proposed rules it is acknowledged that reciprocity could raise concerns about firms engaging in forum shopping to find ‰ЫПeasy graders‰Ыќ this proposal may create the same outcome.  Particularly since you won‰ЫЄt need a warehouse equipment ect. business can almost operate virtually with a post office box.‰ЫўWe do not agree that an applicant should be allowed to not have an inventory and warehouse if it is applying as a Supplier or that an applicant should not be required to have equipment either owned by the applicant or long-term leased from a firm other than the prime contractor as a measure of DBE eligibility.  If a firm is applying as a Broker then a telephone computer and Office space rented (or at home) may be sufficient.  In the case of applicants for Suppliers and Contractors there does need to be a minimum amount of expectations that an applicant is expected to realize.  This section needs to be revised accordingly.  Additionally this is the first time that we have heard from the DOT that the DBE Program serves as ‰ЫПan incubator for start-up businesses‰Ыќ.  The only mention presently of business development in 49 CFR Part 26 is in Appendix C.  If the DOT is transitioning the DBE Program to a USSBA-type business program there will need to be a great deal more focus by Recipients on implementing Appendix C and a much greater level of funding will need to be provided either by Recipients or FHWA (and especially FTA and FAA) to make this a reality;  ‰ЫўCreating a 3-5 year interval between on-site reports will have a significant resource impact (especially if the Interstate Certification construct is in any way implemented).  We agree that on-site reports need to be updated but that the interval should be every five to seven years and not every three to five years.  Regarding use of videoconferencing or other technologies these media do not replace the actual on-site visual inspection necessary to confirm that an applicant has an office/business site inventory sufficient equipment etc.  The actual interview may be conducted via other media but the visual on-site inspection cannot be replaced and will need to be performed by the Home State Recipient.  Regarding charging user fees to applicants we support this proposal if the Interstate Certification proposal is implemented in any form.  Finally additional documentation can not replace the visual on-site inspection.

He has a severe anaphylactic allergy to peanuts and was traveling as an unaccompanied minor to visit his grandparents in FL. Even though we had to drive two hours out of our way to get him to the airport we specifically chose American because they assured us they no longer served peanuts on their flights. Oops.  Despite his wearing a ticket around his neck that had ""severe peanut allergy"" highlighted and being assured by every reservation CSR gate manager and flight attendant that there would be no peanuts served peanuts were served. My son did not eat any but just breathing the particles in the recirclated air caused him to have an allergic reaction. His eyes were swollen shut when he got off the plane and his lips were swollen as well. Despite having a flight manifiest from Skychef showing that peanuts were boarded for the flight and passengers who were willing to testify as witnesses American never admitted to serving peanuts on that flight and in fact suggested my son was exaggerating for the attention.  We settled with American out of court after they put us through hours and hours of deposition.I love peanuts as much as the next person but really people look at the statistics and ask yourself if you'd be willing to have the passenger in the seat next to you die just so you could enjoy your snack.  An airplane just isn't the place to test this proposition.ADA and ACAA should protect people with severe allergies that could be aggravated in flight.

A secondary concern is less severe reactions--more typical with airborne exposure--which leaves the sufferer physically injured (e.g. itchy breakouts of hives difficulty breathing (asthmatic reactions) eczema breakouts that often take days or weeks to heal through topical steriod applications).All of these reactions can be limited though perhaps not eliminated by restricting peanuts and particularly airline distribution of peanuts on airplanes. It would be an innocuous ban. Some commenters have complained that they would be ""inconvenienced"" by a ban on peanuts which is a silly complaint based on expectation of a non-guaranteed service. One could very well make the complaint that they are already so inconvienced by not being served banana splits or cheese fondue on flights. Receiving crackers or pretzels as a snack instead of peanuts is hardly an inconvenience it is a mutually beneficial alternative. The smoking bans on airlines have been truly and rightfully inconveniencing smokers--to the benefit of the general population--on all US flights for 10 years and on most US slights for more than 20 years and the American people their elected representatives and the courts have agreed that the smoking bans are appropriate.Unfortunate as it may be peanut proteins are far more deadly and damaging (in the short term at least) to allergy sufferers than second-hand smoke is to the general population. The problem is that there are too few allergy suffers to mount a broad-based public support campaign.

However after reading a number of the open comments I believe that banning peanuts on flights or flights containing person(s) aboard with these allergies will be very difficult at best.  If a proposed ban on peanuts is passed it will create a whole new category of goods that the TSA agents will now have to look for;  peanuts peanut butter products and any other product that has peanut oil or nuts in their ingredients.  If someone is going to bring them on board for a snack there is no guarantee that any particular passenger will voluntarily give up those products or not eat them during flight.  These items cannot be detected or identified by x-ray or other currently used TSA devices.  I see a real potential for litigation against those that brought/ate them on board or for the peanut dust left behind by the last passenger assigned to that seat.  There are language barriers and many other reasons why someone didn't think or comply that such a ban.  As a frequent flier  I would not support such a ban other than what the airlines already do to help accommodate passengers with this allergy.,DOT-OST-2010-0140,Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2010-0140-0857,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2010-07-12T00:00:00-04:00,Jesse Fuller,Jesse David Fuller,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is the airlines responsibility to treat their passengers with courtesy and respect keeping someone locked up in a crowded air plane with no food water or even air conditioning is the same as keeping them hostage. If the plane cannot take off in a reasonable amount of time (1 hour) then it should return to the gate and allow the passengers to leave the airplane. When the airlines keeps the passengers on the plane against the passengers will they are in affect creating a false arrest or a hostage situation to occur.

Both me and my sister carry Epinephrine.  My sister's son has had several severe reactions so far.  For children/people this sensitive it takes only physical contact (by touching peanut oil on seats & surrounding area or breathing air containing peanut particulate) to cause a severe reaction.  I have avoided flying with my son for this reason.  I have a a friend who traveled on a flight that provided a peanut-free zone voluntarily but because the seats contained previous passengers who ate peanuts or because the peanut particulate was traveling throughout the cabin her son's airway closed up and his face swollen.  She was lucky there was a doctor on board who helped her out she gave the epinephrine and her son's airway opened again.  With so many other options for in-flight snacks it seems ridiculous to me that airlines would even choose to serve something that an increasing number of children are severely allergic to.  I would think that the potential risk of litigation would be enough to ensure they would not choose to serve peanuts but that is just not the case.

People have the right to expect proper treatment for the flight they paid for.  Those with health conditions could very easily have an incident on the plane because of no access to water or food that would effect their medication or lack of medication.  This just opens up the airlines for a major lawsuit not to mention someone having a major health issue such as a heart attack and not being able to get medical attention quickly enough.  Wake up people!  This is totally unacceptable.  That the airlines are also trying to skirt around the current regulations and still allow passengers on a plane for too many hours is even worse.  That is deliberate negligence and shows they couldn't care less about their passengers only that they pay for their ticket.

I DO have children w/severe allergies and would do whatever I need to protect them.  I have flown w/them several times and have had mixed results.  The issue w/peanuts on board is that people can and do react to contact and the particles in the air.  It's next to impossible to keep particles from the air in an enclosed space such as an airline.  I pretreat my children w/Benadryl before flying but we have still had problems w/one of them reacting to a contact.  It is unknown to us whether it was peanuts for him or one of his other numerous allergies.  We are just fortunate that he did not have an anaphylactic episode.  The idea of my child or anyone else having an anaphylactic reaction to something on board a plane is terrifying as getting medical help ASAP is absolutely critical.  I do understand that there are many that may not agree w/the banning of a particular food as people will say that is only just the beginning.  However I consider peanuts to be one of the most high risk allergens due to the particles in the air.  I take any food my children may need w/me as I cannot/do not trust that there will be anything safe for my children when I travel.  I wipe down seats when I travel as well.  I just think it's better to be safe than sorry.  I also have had to deal with airlines NOT keeping flights peanut free even after being assured they will be.  I would think that would open up airlines to lawsuit or liability issue and that would impact the entire industry.

In today's a la carte pricing world many people (particularly families with children) are bringing food from home onto their flights. I imagine a non-trivial percentage of them bring peanuts or peanut butter as part of their in-flight picnic. They eat those foods on the seat back trays and leave trace amounts of nut oil etc. I don't think that anyone would maliciously try to cause fellow passengers to have a sever allergic reaction but someone who does not know the rules (as the many people who fly only a few times a year would not) could cause a dangerous allergic reaction unknowingly.Allergy sufferers will develop a false sense of security if this ban is passed and not take the sensible precautions that allergy sufferers alone are responsible for to keep themselves safe (I say this as someone with food allergies). When not if someone has a severe reaction due to trace contamination they will sue the airline. In America a lawsuit is a given in such a case but the airline has no way of preventing such exposure from food brought BY OTHER PASSENGERS. Worse a peanut ban singles out one group for special treatment. What about people allergic to dairy? To fish or shellfish? To cats or dogs? To fragrances? Do you plan to ban every possible allergen? It simply is not possible. Does that mean that some people with severe allergies may not be able to fly? Yes. Should special case regulations be passed for every contingency? No. Some people (the very pregnant those with severe heart conditions or compromised immune systems etc) cannot fly because the balance of risk outweighs the rewards.

When an individual who has a peanut allergy is 30000 feet in the air in a confined space--should an allergic reaction occur because peanuts are present--the individual has 15 minutes to get to a hospital after having received a shot of epinephrine (Epi-pen).  It is obviously impossible to get that individual to a hospital in that allotted time when in mid-flight.  Peanuts are available to anyone at anytime on the ground and it speaks sadly if people wait to board an airplane in order to eat peanuts‰ЫУthat‰ЫЄs some expensive snack!  Peanuts are available in grocery stores theaters convenience stores wholesale stores sporting events and road-side stands.  Peanut growers‰ЫЄ profits are not more important than one individual‰ЫЄs life.  Also under the Americans With Disabilities Act anyone with a life-threatening food allergy is considered an individual with a disability and airlines do have to comply (as they already know) or risk either a death on their flight and/or a lawsuit.  Either way the airline will lose not only money but whatever good name they may have had.  If someone wants their peanuts they certainly do not have to wait until they board a plane to eat them.,DOT-OST-2010-0140,Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2010-0140-0979,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2010-07-15T00:00:00-04:00,CP Brooks,CP Brooks,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
244,DOT,FALSE,0,2010-08-25T23:59:59-04:00,2010-08-09T00:00:00-04:00,"Community Transit believes that the proposed changes to DOT‰ЫЄs ADA regulations violate the principles of federalism embodied in Executive Order 13132 and that adoption of those proposed changes in their current form would have significant negative consequences for the tens of millions of people who use public transportation. Additionally we believe the proposed changes lack adequate definition and may in fact exceed DOT‰ЫЄs rulemaking authority.The proposed regulatory changes have substantial direct compliance costs. The proposed requirement to provide door-to-door service could make it extremely difficult for a transit agency to efficiently combine paratransit trips leading to greatly expanded vehicle inventories and a need for many more drivers to operate those vehicles.  The proposed regulatory changes are not required by statute. Existing practices in paratransit services and commuter rail boarding have been in place for the entire life of the ADA and the DOT program. To proclaim after 15 years of acceptance of the practices of transit agencies carefully overseen by the FTA that the statute requires these modifications undermines the partnerships and good working relationships that have developed at the local level and provide millions of persons with disabilities transit accessibility often beyond the level of service required by the ADA. Community Transit agrees with the concept of reasonable modification but the manner in which DOT seeks to address it is flawed. DOT should acknowledge that the concept of additional reasonable modification beyond the accommodations prescribed in the current DOT regulations represents a significant change from the historical requirements under the ADA as interpreted by DOT in its regulations and practices; that transit agencies already accomplish necessary or appropriate alterations of their service through local processes with FTA oversight; that full immediate implementation by transit providers would be cost-prohibitive; and that a well-reasoned properly funded approach based on the consensus views of transit providers and their paratransit riders would lead to better service for those riders.This proposal represents a substantial change in long established paratransit practices.  General consensus  and practice have always been that ADA Paratransit requirements served as the reasonable accommodations to public transportation services.  Melton v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) considered the issue after appropriate briefing and argument. The Melton court found it undisputed that DART was exempt from the DOJ regulations finding inter alia that paratransit services are in and of themselves a reasonable modification.  Additionally FTA reviewed and approved the paratransit plan at issue in the Melton case as it has so many others that never provided for reasonable modification as defined by DOT in the NPRM as a departure from the plan. The DOT proposal to graft reasonable modification onto the DOT regulations is a significant change from long established practice.Additionally requests for accommodations beyond mere alteration of pick-up and drop-off points may well include request for alternative fare media exclusive trips reduced scheduling windows extended wait times to accommodate meals or restroom use immediately prior to boarding entry into private streets or complexes or ‰Ычdog-free‰ЫЄ vehicles. Providing these accommodations would entail enormous cost increases.  Implementation of just one aspect of reasonable modification door-to-door service would add substantial costs for many transit agencies by limiting agencies‰ЫЄ ability to employ shared rides. Drivers cannot be expected to routinely leave running vehicles with other riders even for short periods without risking injury to those other riders or theft of paratransit vehicles. A driver assisting a rider to his door would not be able to safely respond to an incident at the vehicle without abandoning the client in his or her immediate care. The alternative turning off the vehicle with other passengers on board is equally unacceptable. Even assuming the most flexible interpretation by FTA consistent door-to-door service cannot be provided without additional costs. APTA believes the basic choice of curb-to-curb service vis-МК-vis door-to-door service should remain a local choice with transit providers providing individualized enhancements or alternatives on an exception basis as locally practical and affordable. The alternative expressed in this rulemaking would reverse that process and make the exception the rule. This change would require transit providers to shift substantial resources from other operations to their paratransit programs to fund programs of reasonable modifications. This shift of operational funding would threaten some agencies‰ЫЄ ability to maintain existing levels of service in the future. Moreover although DOT does not agree with the result in the Melton case it should note carefully that before litigating this matter in the courts the Melton plaintiff asked for an accommodation the transit agency considered the request and determined it was essentially unsafe. Although the plaintiff chose not to utilize the FTA review process FTA had reviewed a case described by the Melton court as ‰ЫПfactually similar‰Ыќ and FTA agreed with the transit agency. The system works and works well.APTA fully supports the intent of proposed change to 49 CFR 37.23 to ensure operations not be shifted to the private sector to avoid ADA requirements. We believe however that the language as drafted may have the unintended effect of interfering with transit agencies‰ЫЄ ability to support non-traditional private programs that give riders with and without disabilities greater options. Community Transit supports as part of a broad coalition of human service providers schools and transit a number of innovative programs.  We recommend DOT carefully review the proposed rule to ensure it does not inadvertently foreclose community outreach and support programs such as these.   With passage of the Safe Accountable Flexible Efficient Transportation Equity Act ‰ЫТ A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) and the advent of the New Freedom program (providing for new service enhancements and improvements beyond those required by the ADA) communities will be better equipped to provide enhanced transportation services to riders with disabilities without etracting from existing accessible services. One of the most important aspects will be the continued ability of transit providers to tailor these enhancements often beyond the scope of ADA paratransit to the needs and desires of their riders. In lieu of blanket requirements that fundamentally and adversely impact our transit systems and passengers DOT should provide leadership to foster freedom choice mobility and independence for persons with disabilities by encouraging transit agencies and the disability community to continue to work together to pursue those goals for the benefit of all riders and by supporting the New Freedom program. The notice seeks input on accessibility standards to be applied to Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems including BRT vehicles. APTA believes BRT systems and vehicles must be accessible but that no single set of standards can be applied to the broad range of systems and equipment used in BRT. Although some BRT vehicles are designed and operated more like light rail vehicles than typical transit buses many BRT systems employ equipment and bus stops typical of normal bus service. These fundamental differences in systems that fall under the BRT umbrella defy application of a single set of standards. Instead system operators should look to the characteristics of their particular system in deciding how best to make it accessible. The Department‰ЫЄs Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations should be updated to establish this standard.Regarding Vehicles for Demand Responsive Service since accessibility of demand responsive services are viewed in their entirety (i.e. the service not individual vehicles must be accessible) under the provisions of 49 CFR 37.77 vehicle acquisition practices should reflect that viewpoint. There is no need for a separate used vehicle provision. Standards for obtaining used vehicles should mirror those for obtaining new vehicles.  Regarding Treatment of Segways and Other Non-Standard Mobility Devices standardized predictable envelope sizes and weights are crucial to universal accessibility. Deviations from the standards without careful analysis and planning risk significant injury to riders with disabilities other passengers and transit employees. We believe that in lieu of attempting to accommodate changes to mobility devices independently the Department should defer to the Access Board in defining the envelope and weight standards applicable to wheelchairs and other mobility devices. Regarding Segways in particular we do not believe they are safe to transport.  Additionally if  transit operators are required to allow them on board there is no guarantee that the rider can take their Segway onto the public streets or sidewalks at their destination since use of the devices is outlawed in some places. DOT should refrain from attempting to dictate changes to mobility device standards without reference to the Access Board. Finally no changes to the standards should be attempted through guidance. All changes should follow the formal rulemaking process.  APTA strongly disagrees with the Department‰ЫЄs proposal to alter the existing methodology for counting missed paratransit trips. We are aware of no data that would suggest that current methods of determining capacity constraints are not effective in detecting them. They have worked for 15 years and absent a problem that is not articulated in the Department's argument there is no need for change.  Although we agree with the Department that each leg of a trip should be considered as a ""trip"" for purposes of the trip denial and missed trip provisions of the regulations we believe the practice of counting denial of one leg of a journey as two missed trips because the rider will not or can not procure alternate transportation for the denied leg is inappropriate. We believe this proposal would nnecessarily skew the data based on the availability and affordability of alternatives. Moreover double counting reflects the reaction to partial unavailability not the actual level of service available. Finally the double counting system could really lead to triple counting if the rider wanted to go from home to physician to pharmacy to home further blurring the actual service availability measure.  We believe counting more then the actual denied trip would also complicate record keeping by forcing grantees to alter their reservation systems. Many trips on paratransit are one-way but depending on how the reservation system works on the system one might never know it. This is because of the expansion of alternative public and private transit opportunities for persons with disabilities greater accessibility of the fixed route reduced or free fares on fixed route and expansion of trip-by-trip eligibility of paratransit riders. The capacity of the paratransit system is therefore best measured by treating each leg separately. However the Department's conclusion that when one leg of a round trip is denied then two denials should automatically be counted flies directly in the face of the individual-leg-as-a-trip concept the Department purports to embrace and would significantly distort the resulting data because those numbers would no longer be a true measure of the capacity of the system.",DOT-OST-2006-23985,Transportation for Individuals With Disabilities,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2006-23985-0385,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2010-09-01T00:00:00-04:00,Gretchen Weber,Gretchen Weber,2105-AD54,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I‰ЫЄm here to tell you that this isn‰ЫЄt the case.  I‰ЫЄll present just a couple of many examples.  I have multiple sclerosis and my hands are frequently spastic and unable to handle change.  I requested that our transit provider allow people with disabilities to purchase reduced fare monthly pass-cards as they do for students.  The request wasn‰ЫЄt outright denied but I received no response to my formal written requests and even speaking at City Hall failed to make this happen.  When the item was added to a class-action federal lawsuit that was joined by the Department of Justice I was finally able to buy a card at the reduced fare (more than a year after the request).  Heretofore I had to handle change each and every time I boarded a bus (difficult if not impossible with my lack of dexterity).Here is another example.  Many like myself with multiple sclerosis are heat intolerant and suffer from extraordinary fatigue.  I asked our transit provider to allow the purchase of monthly fare cards at the downtown depot where those cards are normally for sale.  They only sold those cards one month at a time and only the last week of the month (for the following month).  My request was to buy at least three months in advance so as to avoid unnecessary trips.  I was told yes but it did not happen for more than a year.  Again it took the Department of Justice‰ЫЄs intervention and a Consent Decree to get our transit provider to allow people to purchase several months worth of passes at one time.  What is so strange about this is that one would think that it behooves a company to sell services far in advance since they keep the revenue!

KalickComment on:Docket No. DOT-OST-2010-0140RIN No. 2105-AD92Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections     Andrew Kalick respectfully contends that DOT's proposed rulemaking addresses long overdue issues. Mr.Kalick feels that tarmac delays and all other matters proposed by DOT and their associated provisions should be included in the contract of carriage. He also approves of the Business Traveler's Coalition comments in their entirety. His comments under this docket number and RIN more urgently address the Choice of Forum and Denied Boarding Rules. Related to these two subject areas Kalick first and foremost believes that DOT lacks authority to regulate (propose rules/enforce current ones) that meddle in individual contractual affairs the ambit of which denied boarding falls (already in the contract of carriage.) Further increasing denied boarding compensation rates is hardly an action that will significantly if at all address the burden increasing involuntary denied boardings impose on passengers. The denied boarding compensation is based on the percentage of remaining flight coupons a fact often ommitted from pundit comments. The airlines simply do not bump lower fare tickets. These lower fare tickets that passengers purchase are often if not exclusively the targets of denied boarding. Not only are they the overwhelming targets airlines bump these passengers with complete disregard for the passengers and with relative impunity. Current and proposed amendments to the regulations at hand are in place and enforced without sole/preemptive authority. Passengers retain the right to pursue actions in state/federal courts in denied boarding/contractual actions. Supreme court precedent is very clear as to this point.    Kalick is confident that peanuts will be found to cause allergic reactions in a closed environment such as an airplane and hopes that the agency/persons tasked with the investigation will come to the same conclusion.,DOT-OST-2010-0140,Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2010-0140-1961,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2010-09-30T00:00:00-04:00,Andrew Kalick,Andrew P.

I think if more and more airlines took preventitive measures to make flights peanut-free they would not only calm the worries of many parents of children with peanut allergies but they also would be watching out for themselves should someone have an allergy attack while on their flight. Imagine the negative publicity or perhaps even lawsuit that they could avoid simply by taking this one simple step.

When traveling on a plane that serves peanuts I have a reaction to the peanuts being served around me.  Thankfully most airlines ban peanuts so air travel has been much more pleasant in recent years.  Unfotunately I recently flew on Delta which I learned the hard way is one of two domestic airliens still serving peanuts.  On this flight as peanuts were served around me I developed a mild but annoying reaction - eyes watering stuffy and sneezing the whole flight.  I will never fly Delta again as long as they serve peanuts - I do not think a ban of a few rows is adequate given how air is circulated on a plane.  I think most intelligent peanut-allergic consumers will avoid Delta and Southwest but certainly would not object to a ban and think a ban could protect consumers who inadvertantly fly Delta or Southwest without realizing they serve peanuts.  My belief is that eventually a peanut-allergy sufferer will have a severe reaction on a Delta or Southwest flight and sue the airline which might convince them to be more concerned about their cutomers.  I would think the airlines would voluntarily remove peanuts to reduce this risk but maybe government regulation is needed.Thank you for your time.,DOT-OST-2010-0140,Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2010-0140-1309,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2010-09-13T00:00:00-04:00,Jonathan Masters,Jonathan Masters,Not Assigned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Peanut protein is so sticky that it sticks to surfaces and those who come in contact will touch this and have a reaction. Often it is a reaction of hives and then my breathing is labored.  If anyone has had hives it is not pleasant.  It will be the small child who when her/his parents aren't looking will stick their fingers in their mouth and then what??

I have flown numerous times with my assistance dog and a primary concern has always been my dog's welfare because toileting has almost always been impossible to accomplish.On a few occasions when flying regional carriers I've been able to toilet my dog outdoors in an out of the way place on the tarmac. On only one occasion when I had a 3 hour layover was I able to make my way to the outdoor dog area at the Atlanta Airport so my dog could eliminate between flights. That area in my mind is nearly useless. It is so small and located adjacent to a very busy roadway which is very dangerous for dogs.Whenever I've flown I've tried to be proactive and find out where dog relief areas are at the airports I will be traveling through but the simple fact is that they are always located outside of the secure areas are generally located at a great distance from the arrival gates and it's not possible for me to get to and from that area before my connection leaves both because of the distances involved and the time it would take to get through security again.Any other times I've flown in the last 12+ years my dog has either needed to ""hold it"" or I have resorted to having him eliminate on a CHUX pad placed on the floor in the ladies' restroom which I've then bagged and disposed of in the trash can. This really is not an acceptable solution to me but it's the only one available at this time. There have been times when I've been stuck in a gate area for hours due to weather or maintenance issues but could not leave because the flight could be called at any minute. This jeopardizes my dog's health.It's vital that airports provide accessible areas for assistance dog relief within the secure areas. If there is more than one terminal it would be best if each one had a dog relief area or at least be centrally located so that distances could be minimized.",DOT-OST-2011-0182,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance (U.S. Airports),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2011-0182-0078,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2011-11-22T00:00:00-05:00,Sue Matthews,Sue Matthews,2105-AD91,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I travel frequently and often have connecting flights with short time intervals between them. We have to wait to be last off the plane with our wheelchairs and then are expected to be first on board for the next flight. With bathrooms on planes not accessible I have to find time to use the bathroom facilities myself as well as taking care of my service dog's needs. Having to go all the way out to the front of an airport and then have to go through the entire TSA screening again makes this entirely impossible. The screening also takes longer as we have to wait for a female officer and the patdown procedure takes forever. It would probably take a minimum of 2 hours between flights to accomplish this and there is never that much time. At one airport the only way to let my dog get relief was to have an airport employee take her from me and disappear to ""someplace"" that they could take the dog. This is entirely unacceptable having to separate me from my service dog especially to a stranger. The look on my dog's face as she was walked away by a stranger spoke volumes. She looked back at me the entire time until they were out of sight. She could not understand why she was being separated from her responsibility. It was heartbreaking and very stressful.

I definitely support the DOT‰ЫЄs decision to extend protection coverage to all dogs and cats and I want the rule to extend reporting requirements to all animals shipped commercially not just dogs and cats. I believe that reporting requirements are essential to inform consumers about the risks associated with transporting animals by air and people deserve this information so they can make informed decisions about traveling safely with their pets. I hate to say that I was unaware of how dangerous and deadly shipping pets as cargo can often be and I want all people to be aware so that their pets get the best care and love possible from the informed caretaker.

She had been examined by my vet the day before her flight and was given a clean bill of health.  My dog was very healthy never sick or injured. Only time she went to the vet was for her yearly check up and vaccines.  She was extremely friendly and when I went to pick her up Northwest Airlines used a forklift to move her kennel over to the pickup area. As soon as I let her out I noticed she was very stiff in one hind leg but thought it was because of the length of time she was in the kennel.  She was flown in the cargo area of the plane.  After about 3-4 days at home she was still stiff but also lame on her left hind leg so I took her to a vet clinic here.  They took xrays and sent me to a canine specialist for ACL damage.  She had severe damage to her stifle area and required surgery costing approx. $2700 the specialist opinion was that while she was in her kennel the airlines dropped her while moving her to or from a plane.  The damage done came from a significant event the Northwest denied it and even though I could have gone to court with the vet clean bill of health the day before she left and the specialist report I didn't have the money to go after Northwest.  Northwest told me that they would keep it delayed in court and cost me thousands of dollars if I went after them for the cost of my dogs surgery.  I will NEVER fly a animal on any airline as cargo AGAIN.  Since then I have never flown with Northwest I completely avoid them.,DOT-OST-2010-0211,Animal Legal Defense Fund - Petition to Amend 14 C.F.R.

I think they should be required to show you live video that you can access on flight.  That would ensure decent handling of animals and proper safety codes. I also think that baggage handling of animals needs safety codes. I saw our cat's cage underneath FIVE huge bags as it was hauled back into the terminal.  He was terrified by the time I picked him up.  Little wonder!!It's time for all creatures not just pets to be treated with respect and care.  They are not concrete inanimates.  They are sentient just as we are.  Reporting all deaths is only the beginning for their deserved status.By the way in consequence of my doubts about safety in flight we don't go by plane any more when taking our cat.  I drive and take ferries.  It's safer.  I can leave kitty in the car in safety and also go and see that he is OK part way through the sail with an attendant with me.,DOT-OST-2010-0211,Animal Legal Defense Fund - Petition to Amend 14 C.F.R.

That starts with reporting and tracking 'incidents' so bad practices can be revealed and stopped.Please comment now through Regulations.gov to improve the system of reporting death and/or injury of an animal during air travel as cargo.Currently U.S. airlines are required to report only cases in which a family pet such as a dog or cat is involved. Regulations do not include animals shipped for commercial purposes including dogs from puppy mills birds for the pet trade or primates being shipped to laboratories.However the DoT is proposing to expand requirements to ""include all cats and dogs transported by the carrier regardless of whether the cat or dog is transported as a pet by its owner or as part of a commercial shipment."" Under these rules airlines would also report the total number of killed/injured animals as well as the total number of animals transported as cargo.This proposed expansion does not go far enough. All animals should be counted regardless of their 'purpose' or flight itinerary. Doing so not only allows consumers to make educated decisions when choosing an airline it also helps to keep those responsible for the well-being of animals during transport accountable. Different species of animals can have very different needs and some like primates require special care particularly during long journeys which are very stressful.Importantly a complete picture of such activities cannot be achieved unless the regulations are expanded to include all airplanes that transport passengers along with animal cargo regardless of size as well as those that only transport cargo.Last year AAVS documented the use and importation of primates for research and outlined the hazards associated with transporting these animals in its report entitled ""Primates by the Numbers.""

My father was an air systems engineer for a major airplane manufacturer.  I remember a case in 1973 when several racing greyhounds were killed or injured while being transported as cargo in the hold of an airplane.  He had to calculate how much oxygen was available for the animals during flight and I helped him research the problem via reading articles in my university library and bring back copies.  There was a lawsuit as $$$$$ was involved.  That was 39 years ago and we are still seeing problems with this result.  Enough is enough.  Animals are not inanimate cargo.  They require air and water.  They need to be placed in the cargo hold in a way that their air supply is not blocked.  Cargo handlers just throw stuff in the cargo hold and to BLEEP with it.  I recommend regulations and training for cargo handlers and airline personnel.  The USA usually represents the best of humanitarian efforts in the world.

Most certifiers are college graduates and not accountants. We have no way of knowing if all documents which should be provided are. President Obama recently announced support of tax changes for individuals with adjusted gross receipts of $400000 or more defining those individuals as ‰ЫПwealthy.‰Ыќ $400000 would be a reasonable standard for a bright line approach.US DOT has experts who specialize in certification denial appeals. Those experts should develop  training for recipients about where to look for items regarding personal net worth (and small business size) on U.S. tax forms. The guidance should reference specific lines schedules and forms.The spouse or domestic partner of an applicant should not be required to submit PNW statements. DBE certification requirements are very intrusive particularly for those working in the non-construction arena. Many businesses including those working on US DOT funded contracts refuse to apply for certification. If the bright line PNW approach is used it would be reasonable to require a spouse/domestic partner to provide the most recent three consecutive years of personal federal income tax forms only when the spouse or domestic partner is affiliated with the applicant firm.DBE Commitments/Awards and Payment Reporting FormRegarding comment about the ‰ЫПinability to break out woman-owned DBE participation by race; ‰Ы_.‰ЫП this would make an already complicated process more complicated. ,DOT-OST-2012-0147,Disadvantaged Business Enterprise: Program Implementation Modifications,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2012-0147-0093,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2012-12-19T00:00:00-05:00,NA,Anonymous,2105-AE08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Things are bad enough nowadays with the general rudeness exhibited by so many flyers.  Two weeks ago I took a total of four flights in a week.

Having 300 people in a cramped enclosed space for hours on end with say 10% of them at any given time talking (loudly) into their phones would make flights unendurably noisy. It's important when you are forced to be cheek by jowl and shoulder to shoulder with a horde of strangers to be able to maintain a sense of privacy; allowing cellphone use would destroy this entirely. You would be always in the presence of at least one person shouting to make himself or herself heard above engine noise and the surrounding crowd. And these conversations would probably be long ones; the caller has nothing very much else to do after all.One of the least-liked ""types"" of fellow passengers is the loud talker whose conversation intrudes on the thoughts and quiet conversations of everyone within 3 rows and seats. Allowing cellphone use on flights would institutionalize this intrusion and to no real benefit. Cellphone use would provide entertainment and distraction from boredom not usually anything critical to anyone's well-being. The effect this rule would have on the mood of the planeload of people would be significant and negative. Think of yourself in this situation: you are sitting next to someone talking laughing discussing family matters all at a volume that can't be ignored. What do you do? You can ask them to talk more softly but they can't since the engine noise requires you speak up so you can be heard at all. You can ask them to hang up because they're talking too loud and you can't hear yourself think; they'll refuse since they're having a perfectly good time. Later you'll *tell* them to hang up; they'll refuse probably rudely. So you tell the flight attendant who has no legal basis for telling them to hang up and must therefore appeal to reason and fair play--never a winning strategy. So there you are sitting next to an ongoing noise source (or two or three) that will not shut up and cannot be compelled to do so. Imagine the frustration. You would certainly be wondering what you have in your possession that you could use to force them to quiet down; what do have that you could use as a cudgel?Now multiply by 300. Managing the mood of a planeful of people is an important component to running a flight. Allowing cellphone use on a flight will make this increasingly difficult. In any group of 300 individuals there are a couple who don't handle frustration well; this rule sets up a situation where those individuals are tested more than any of us would like.Finally this would do the airlines no particular good. They would feel obliged to install the cell equipment on their planes and then would have to bear the consequent decrease in nearly everyone's desire to fly. They would end up spending money to make people like them less.This rule would do a lot of real damage to the already marginal flying experience and would add nothing of real value.

329,DOT,FALSE,0,2014-03-31T23:59:59-04:00,2014-02-27T00:00:00-05:00,Dear Docket Clerk:These comments are submitted on behalf of the Central Contra Costa Transit Authority (County Connection). County Connection operates fixed route and paratransit service within central Contra Costa County in the suburban San Francisco area. Our service area is over 200 sq. miles with a population of over 500000. We provide over five million transit trips annually on a combined annual operating budget of just over 35 million dollars. I am writing to provide comments on the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) request for comments on the Next Phase of the Regulatory Review of Existing Department of Transportation (DOT) Regulations published February 27 2014 at 79 FR 11051.OST has offered a number of options for managing this review process including simplyasking for specific rules in need of review focusing on a list identified by DOT in 2011 focusing ona specific operating administration or focusing on cross-cutting rules. We do not believe any ofthese options are mutually exclusive and that all have merit based on a wide range of factors.There are specific rules that standing alone are unduly restrictive and cause the regulatedcommunity to expend excessive time and money to achieve compliance. DOT should seekrecommendations on these specific rules to be reviewed.The 56 rules cited in the Federal Register should be explained in greater detail. The referenceto Attachment 2 of the Department‰ЫЄs 2011 final plan leads to a reprint of a routine Section 610 noticeand does not clearly specify which of the rules the Department identified as having potential savings.Once clarified we would encourage OST to seek additional information from the public and use thatinformation to prioritize its list.Since the impact of rules is often cumulative OST should pursue a modal review to ascertainthe overall regulatory burden on the regulated community and specifically to identify those areaswhere differing rules require the same or similar information to be processed and presented indifferent ways. This review should not be limited to existing rules but also those being developed.Similarly OST should focus on cross-cutting issues to eliminate unnecessary costs andconfusion. Buy America with many differing interpretations of compliance should be an immediatefocus. While the underlying statutes may differ the differences are exacerbated in widely divergentregulatory schemes and practices within the Department. Moreover projects that draw funding frommore than one modal administration require clear guidance on what rule applies. As the FederalTransit Administration crafts its safety program OST must ensure that the program can reasonablyco-exist with the Federal Railroad Administration‰ЫЄs program to avoid duplicative counter-productiveefforts.Within this exercise OST should also look to the various Circulars and other guidancedocuments that have become de facto rules through practice oversight and other modaladministration actions. While an underlying regulation may be benign the interpretation andenforcement of the rule is often cumbersome. We have found that review processes have tendedover time to enlarge regulatory requirements through the threat of adverse findings and these defacto rules carry the same potential for wasting time and money as formal regulations.Finally the Department should examine its rulemaking processes. Delay and uncertainty inthe regulatory process only compound the ill effects noted above. As an example OST proposedchanges to its regulations related to services for people with disabilities in 2006. Over eight yearslater the proposals are still pending. Federal courts in multiple circuits have found themunenforceable before they are finalized yet they are regularly enforced through adverse reviewfindings. This leads to confusion for agencies providing the services the passengers dependent onthe services and the state and local governments responsible for funding the services.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.Rick RamacierGeneral ManagerCounty Connection 2477 Arnold Industrial WayConcord CA 94520925-680-2050,DOT-OST-2014-0024,Next Phase of the Regulatory Reviews of Existing DOT Regulations,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2014-0024-0031,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Central Contra Costa Transit Authority (County Connection),2014-04-01T00:00:00-04:00,Rick Ramacier,Central Contra Costa Transit Authority (County Connection),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Average consumers can't be expected to understand complex fare construction and know for example that YQ (commonly used fare code for fuel surcharges) are meant to be included in some fares (British Airways) and not in others (American Airlines). If the YQ is absent British Airways would call it a mistake fare but buyers of tickets on their partner American would not know to look for that identify the error and then avoid the booking because it had been mislabeled.  Airlines had carte blanche before CFR 399.88 was in place to choose when they would and would not be responsible for their mistakes.  They could choose to ""honor"" a fare out of goodwill or to avoid legal action but this is unfair to consumers.  If I as a consumer buy a product and make a mistake when I purchase it I don't get to choose whether or not to ""honor"" my original purchase but rather I am subject to the company's return policy which is non-uniform and can vary store to store and state to state.

My company builds transportation projects that receive federal assistance from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and/or the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Local hiring preferences force me to discriminate against some of my workers by laying them off because I have to hire new workers from the jurisdiction with the preference. My workers are well trained and highly skilled. These skills allow our company to offer the taxpayers a high quality construction project that is built safely at the lowest possible cost. Because of the need to lay off some of my workers I may choose not to bid on projects with these requirements. This limits competition and can increase project costs.I understand the motivation to force contractors to hire unemployed individuals on federally-funded projects; however this is not the way to accomplish this goal.

Our Organization would like to work with you as well as with airline manufacturers on the future designs of new airplanes to be wheelchair accessible. We are specifically concerned about power chairs in which the passenger is unable to transfer themselves or in which traveling in a standard airline seat would risk their physical health and safety.Currently neither the Department of Transportation's Air Carrier Access Act nor the ADA resolves the needs for those who are dependent on wheelchairs and commercial flight.  The ADAs requirements for public transportation providers are generally the same whether they are public agencies or private contractors.  Standards apply to facilities and vehicles.  Unfortunately the airline industry has been excluded from having to make revisions to existing aircraft or from having to currently make any advancement in designs for future planes going into production.  We are requesting that the airline industry as a whole come together to address the lack of progress in this area and address the needs of the disabled flyer who uses  a wheelchair and can not be transferred or travel safely in a regular seat.All Wheels Up Inc.is here to be liaisons of information from the wheelchair industry rehabilitation regulations industry as well as providing financial data to show you how safe and profitable it will be for wheelchair users to travel commercially.    We are also a professional organization that understands things do not change overnight. The reality is that at the end of the day a big business like yours wants to know the dollars and cents. So what is the big picture and how do you benefit?   First of all we are not asking you to retrofit existing planes. This would be a huge expense. What we are asking is for you to look to the future and set the ground work for the future of aviation accessibility. And secondly with the increasing number of people using wheelchairs each year the airline industry will realize significant revenue exponential. As an industry you are not just excluding the one person who is disabled from flying  but you are losing the revenue of the approximately four additional seat sales.  A disabled person rarely flies alone. They travel with their families as well as and in many cases with a care taker or nurse.  Do you want this this family of four plus one care taker driving to their next destination due to how difficult it is to fly?  if you get just half of the population that are in power chairs that currently does not fly to fly  your revenue would increase in the multi million dollar range. In 2008 one particular airline spent over $1 Million in wheelchair repairs.   This figure also does not include the expenses that airlines outlay every year to disabled travelers in lawsuits free tickets and additional items to prevent lawsuits.SolutionThe next step:  All Wheels Up has raised the funds and has done the research and will be conducting the first ever crash test of wheelchairs for commercial flight at an FAA approved Crash test facility.  We would like you to request the major aircraft manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus) to consider a design for wheel chair accessible cabins.  With this request the FAA has confirmed they will act upon our request to crash test wheelchairs.  Take note a large majority of the work and reports have already been conducted.  The FAA would only need to expand on the research already done from the company Q'straint whose restraining systems have passed the 20 G crash test while all air craft passenger seats have only passed a 16 G crash test. Due to this study alone the FAA is excited to work on the crash testing wheelchairs for commercial flight.  In addition hundreds of wheelchair models have already undergone extensive crash testing by the RERC  WTS (Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Wheelchair Transportation Safety) due to the WC18 regulation funded by the NIDRR (National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research).  These tests conducted show all wheelchairs have also passes a 20 G frontal crash test again surpassing the 16G crash test standard for commercial airline seats.All Wheels up and like minded companies have the solution. All we need is you to take the next step with us. We look forward to you having further conversations with us regarding crash testing wheelchairs for commercial flight.Michele ErwinAll Wheels Up Founder and President917-414-0897,DOT-OST-2015-0246,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel; Consideration of Negotiated Rulemaking Process,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2015-0246-0009,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,All Wheels Up inc,2015-12-21T00:00:00-05:00,Michele Erwin,Comment from Michele Erwin,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specifically I am aware of individuals from Canada who used an online service to obtain paperwork for a faked psychiatric disorder. They then traveled to Aruba registered feral street dogs as ESAs with the online service and then forced the airlines to fly them for free to the U.S.. These animals were advertised as ""available"" in advance of their trip and were then sold after arriving in Canada. In no instance did they travel TO Aruba with an ESA. Over a six month period at least 12 different animals were claimed as ESAs. Some adult dogs were even transported in cabin putting passenger and crew at risk.The airlines were made aware of these activities but are generally unable to deny transport even when presented with clear and documented evidence of fraud. It is certainly a misuse of flying ESAs when it is done simply to transport a ""personal pet"" when there is no real or legitimate emotional need. In this case it is even more egregious because there is clearly NO ""personal"" connection with the animals they are defrauding the airline into paying the cost to ship them the animals are immediately being dispersed or sold and the intent is to ensure the airline cannot deny their transport. Airlines must have the ability to deny transport of ESAs when there is clear evidence of fraud without the fear of lawsuits.",DOT-OST-2015-0246,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel; Consideration of Negotiated Rulemaking Process,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2015-0246-0273,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00,Susan Busch,Comment from Susan Busch,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I am aghast that DOT is thinking of requiring third party medical clearance for flying with any type of service animal. This makes no sense. Many people with disabilities do not see their doctor regularly about their disability. For example someone who is missing a limb from birth doesn't need to go to the doctor to verify that their limb is still indeed missing. Many people with disabilities are stable medically and do not see a doctor regularly. Other individuals on state aid may have to wait 9 months or more in order to even see a doctor (like I had to) and they may not get the doctor to approve their assistive device as other things are more pressing during the quick 15 min doctor visit. For most of us we aren't rich and a visit to a doctor can be quite expensive. Additionally most doctors are fearful of lawsuits and refuse to write notes or fill out paperwork pertaining to my service animal.A decision tree or attestation provides credible assurance that the person is disabled and needs to use a service animal. Hopefully the decision tree or attestation would also include an educational component so that people can accurately fill out the form and know what their rights and responsibilities are in air travel.

Refunding Baggage Fees for Delayed Checked Bags 81 Fed. Reg. 75347 75348 (Oct. 31 2016). First this comment argues that the policy best for consumers is to stop the clock once baggage arrives at the final destination airport. Second it argues why this rule would survive a potential Chevron challenge.It would be in the best interest of consumers to stop the clock once baggage arrives at the destination airport. I focus on one reason: it would least increase baggage fee prices. The clock can most plausibly stop in three situations: when bags are delivered to (1) the passenger's person; (2) the passenger's permanent or temporary residence; or (3) the destination airport. The first two present such substantial delivery costs that airlines would often choose to refund the baggage fee rather than deliver on time. Accordingly airlines to compensate higher costs would likely raise baggage fee prices more under the first two options.This rule would likely survive a Chevron challenge. If ""Congress has directly spoken"" to when the clock stops then DOT ""must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress."" Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resource Defense Council Inc. 467 U.S. 837 842-43 (1984). A challenger may say Congress was unambiguous;  ""deliver[ed] . . . to the passenger"" means what it says. FAA Extension Safety and Security Act of 2016 Pub. L. No. 114-190  2305(a)(1) 130 Stat. 615 640-41. But one cannot unambiguously determine what ""deliver[ed] . . . to the passenger"" means. Plain meaning would only permit the clock to stop once baggage reaches the passenger's person. This could produce absurd results imposing enormous costs on airlines while they race to find passengers wherever they are. It is a well-settled canon of statutory interpretation that absurd results can make a statute's otherwise plain meaning mean something else. If delivery to the passenger does not mean delivery to the passenger then the statute is ambiguous. And an agency's interpretation of an ambiguous statute need only be a ""permissible construction."" Chevron 467 U.S. at 843. Because courts rarely find agency constructions of ambiguous statutes impermissible and because stopping the clock once baggage arrives at the destination airport would both promote consumer welfare and comport with a plausible understanding of baggage delivery this rule would likely survive judicial review.",DOT-OST-2016-0208,Refund baggage fee for delayed bags,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2016-0208-0047,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00,Daniel Rios,Comment from Daniel Rios,2105-AE53,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The minor but incessant annoyances experienced by air travelers--fussy babies unnecessarily fragrant food the passenger in front of you who insists on reclining his seat fully-- are the stuff of bad stand-up and dull dinner conversations. When you trap a couple hundred people in claustrophobic quarters for hours at a time small grievances are amplified and tempers flare and it is in the government's interest to protect American flyers from unnecessary hardship while they are unable to deplane. The proposed measure is perfectly within the Department of Transportation's purview and I support its adoption. I recognize that this measure is not an outright ban on voice-calls but rather would require airlines to disclose their policy regarding them. This is a reasonable expectation to impose upon carriers that would increase the ability of the consumer to make well-informed choices about which carrier to patronize. I also appreciate the limitation of the rule's effect to airline carriers that are not small entities thus avoiding any undue burden on smaller businesses. However in response to the request for comment on a possible full ban of voice calls on commercial aircraft I must insist that any full ban of voice calls would be a drain on government time and an unnecessary imposition on airline carriers.It should not be taken lightly that international carriers that permit voice calls have not been inundated with customer complaints. The ""Comments on the ANPRM"" section of the proposed rule document admits to this fact. Its rebuttal that American consumers expect a voice-call-free cabin however pays no respect to the ability of American consumers to adjust to technological change. In today's world when most Americans carry some mobile device with them Americans expect to be digitally connected at all times. Airlines' move to offer in-flight wifi has been met largely with enthusiasm if some frustration when it does not function properly. This should be an indication that Americans do value staying connected while travelling. It is also entirely possible that the majority of consumers would use the ability to make voice calls considerately. After all people playing music aloud from their mobile devices is not a common complaint for air travelers despite the fact that most have devices capable of such action.Perhaps the most notable reason a full ban is not necessary is that this proposed rule would already disincentivize airlines from allowing voice calls; if only those carriers who permit voice calls on flights are required to disclose their policy to consumers prior to the purchase of tickets the carriers may avoid any costs associated with doing so by simply prohibiting voice calls to begin with. In this way the rule would maintain what the proposed rule document considers the status quo-- that voice calls are not allowed on flights-- making an outright ban on voice calls appear even less necessary.The proposed rule is acceptable however because it still allows for carriers to make the ultimate decision on whether or not to allow voice calls as they are perfectly capable of doing. If the benefits of permitting voice calls are something that appeals to consumers airlines are perfectly able to allow them though they may be more apt to attach an additional charge for the service to offset the costs of conforming to this proposed regulation and informing consumers of their policy in advance. The technology currently available would allow for carriers to restrict voice calls during certain times like at take-off and landing or during sleeping hours--all measures which would assuage major passenger concerns about disruption and lost sleep. The proposed rule does enough to preserve the status quo that there is no need for an explicit ban and market forces are sufficient to moderate voice call use without more serious government regulation.Government regulation restricting voice calls is simply not needed at this time. If as the proposed rule document suggests an increase in airlines' technical ability to allow voice calls leads to a higher incidence of people actually making voice calls while in the air further restrictions in the form of federal regulations may be prudent. Even then though it is entirely likely that airlines themselves will be able to resolve any mass consumer dissatisfaction by simply limiting the times during which voice calls are acceptable. While I recognize that government action banning voice calls may be necessary in the future for now let the individual airlines--and societal bounds of propriety-- sort out this issue.",DOT-OST-2014-0002,Use of Mobile Wireless Devices for Voice Calls on Aircraft,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2014-0002-8343,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2017-02-27T00:00:00-05:00,Jaden Young,Comment from Jaden Young,2105-AE30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Even before takeoff you see people who are speaking loudly on their phones - even during the flight attendant safety speech. Many people even enter the aircraft while on the phone - crooking their neck to accommodate their cell phone while banging you or your seat while they struggle with their luggage in one hand and their bag in the other - oblivious to the chaos and spectacle they are creating.Secondly many people engage in vulgar language when on a call even when strangers and children are within earshot. Many times their voice volume cannot be modulated without many times incurring the wrath of the caller. Even worse I have seen many people hold court on their phone with the speaker phone on so that the WHOLE plane can hear about ""how bad Aunt Martha's bunion surgery turned out"" ""what groceries they need to buy for the party"" or can you believe how hot the new secretary is?"". Most people don't care.Moreover many flights are made during early morning or late at night when travelers are trying to catch up on the rest they missed in accommodating their early/late flight. Incessant phone chatting would only add to their fellow travelers discomfort and dissapointment. There are VERY few calls that MUST take place on an air plane while in flight. To impose this burden on travelers who are already constrained and annoyed by the latest airline-imposed fees for baggage food seat and luggage restrictions - flying has become less about enjoyment and convenience and more about bearing the brunt and expanding ones capacity for enduring the experience. Adding incessant noise from possibly dozens of people chattering away in differing volumes different languages and differing ideas as to their choice of words and congeniality to the plight or concern of their fellow travelers feelings comfort and peace will be the straw that breaks the camels back - and could even lead to more disruption in flight caused by people fighting about this situation. I am convinced that the airlines desire to add the availability of ""in flight phone calls"" is not driven by a desire to offer their customers a ""benefit"" but simply ANOTHER way for them to gouge out even more incremental income by making them use the wifi systems on their planes for said phone calls.

Many years ago there was technology on some flights to allow calls using headsets built into the back of seats. I witnessed a very loud call that disturbed DOZENS of people around the caller who had to yell to be heard. Flight attendants and others politely asked him to quiet down. He said he could barely be heard on the other end. He also said that he had been trying to reach this person for weeks and had to negotiate and close the contract or lose his job...The flight crew had to intercede. The irate caller handed the headset to the captain who was verbally harassed by the caller on the other end who threatened to get the pilot fired...Are we going to have conflicts on flights with people claiming freedom of speech? Unless you provide an old fashioned telephone booth on the plane so calls will not impact others this will not work. I would have to bring ear plugs for my children so they would not overhear any rudeness or something as innocent as a discussion on Santa. Who can i sue when a stranger talking loudely ruins the illusion of Santa for my child? What price can the legal profession attach to that? Despite the idea that the market will decide and I could pay extra to take a flight on a voice free flight the availability of flights limits me. In a public setting like a mall if an overheard conversation offends me i can leave. I cannot leave a flight in mid air. Allowing voice calls is a very bad idea that will lead to conflict and thus violence on planes. The plane cabin environment stress level is already high and allowing voice calls will dangerously escalate it. Text and email is widespread and available as an alternative. ,DOT-OST-2014-0002,Use of Mobile Wireless Devices for Voice Calls on Aircraft,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2014-0002-3815,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2017-01-03T00:00:00-05:00,Stephen Obrien,Comment from Stephen Obrien,2105-AE30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However it is not the place of the Department of Transportation (""DOT"" or the ""Department"") to impose this restriction. Airlines - operating in the free-market - should have the ability to decide their own policies on the use of mobile wireless devices on their aircrafts. The proposed rule of requiring sellers of air transportation to provide advance notice to passengers if the flight allows voice calls is just and will actively prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in air transportation.The Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) issued by the Department in 2014 was met with 96 percent of commenters opposed to allowing voice calls on airplanes. This overwhelming majority of opinion clearly demonstrates the public sentiment against the use of voice calls on commercial flights. Airlines that ignore these statistics will find themselves struggling to sell tickets. All domestic airlines are aware of this consequence since they currently do not allow the use of voice calls on their flights even though there is no federal restriction prohibiting it. Thus there is no reason for the federal government to issue such a regulation banning voice calls if the airline market is already regulating itself on this matter. However if a commercial airline were to allow voice calls the airline should alert the consumer prior to purchasing a ticket. There is no room for debate on this issue as it directly falls under 49 U.S.C. 41712. This code states that an airline cannot be ""deceptive or unfair"" in its operations. The overwhelming majority of consumers do not support the use of voice calls on flights. Therefore in not alerting a consumer that a particular flight allows voice calls the airline is deceiving the consumer into the purchase of a ticket. The information gap between the airline and the consumer is deceptive and unfair and would be grounds for prosecution under 40 U.S.C. 41712. Not alerting a passenger in advance that the flight they are taking allows the use of wireless devices to make voice calls puts them in an unfair position. Such a passenger would find themselves stuck on a flight that they would never have boarded. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has very strict regulations on the ability to get on and off an aircraft. If a consumer unknowingly gets on an aircraft that allows the unlimited use of voice calls this puts the consumer in a situation that has the potential to cause emotional distress and increase levels of ""air rage."" Air rage has the ability to cause widespread disruption on an airplane so much so that it can disturb the pilot and potentially cause the cancellation of a flight. One of the most extreme examples of air rage recently occurred when a passenger on a plane had an emotional breakdown due to Ivanka Trump being on his flight. The air rage became so prevalent that the distressed individual had to be escorted off the plane causing the flight to be delayed for many hours. This same problem could easily occur from disturbing phone calls. These types of situations could be avoided if the airline alerts its passengers of special circumstances having to do with a flight including the ability to make voice calls. Nevertheless I believe there is a strong difference between the allowance of voice calls and ""inbound listen only"" calls. Airlines should be willing to allow listen only calls and should not be required to alert consumers of this allowance. An inbound listen call is synonymous to listening to music or watching a video on an aircraft. If the consumer is participating in a conference call - with the use of headphones and does not need to reciprocate any information back to the call - I can find no difference between such actions and listening to a podcast or song. The proposed regulation states that the cost of such legislation would be $41 million to airline carriers between 2017 and 2026. Ticket revenue for airlines in 2017 is expected to be over $10 billion. Thus the cost of complying with this new rule would be a rounding error for airlines. Such a miniscule cost should not be a deterrent to the DOT in passing this new rule. On the other hand the costs of not passing such a regulation could be substantial. These costs would be comprised of lawsuits by airline customers who claim to have been emotionally injured by these unsuspecting calls. In summary I am fully in support of the proposed rule by the Department that would force airlines to provide advance notice to their customers if their flight allows voice calls. I also support the airline's power to decide on their own whether or not to allow the use of voice calls on their flights. Airlines should be able to conduct their business as they see fit as long as they do so in a safe fair and transparent manner.

A major burden on transportation in the United States is failure to align regulatory standards with other well-developed regulatory systems requiring public bodies in the United States to pay higher prices for customized versions of (say) trains that can be purchased off-the-shelf in Europe. I strongly urge DOT to adopt a regulations allowing regulated parties to satisfy U.S. regulations by demonstrating compliance with well-respected foreign regulations such as those in Canada Europe or Japan.2. Environmental reviews are essential but significantly delay projects. I urge the Department to investigate how to simplify the environmental process. In particular the Department should strongly consider promulgating regulations or requesting legislation to prevent litigation over environmental studies from derailing projects by allowing payment of mitigation fees in lieu of vacating an approval due to technical defects in environmental studies.3. The cost of rail and other public transportation projects is significantly increased by regulations that treat brief delays of private vehicles as significant impacts requiring extensive studies and costly mitigation spending. California recently reformed its state environmental review law CEQA to use alternative measures such as Vehicle Miles Traveled in lieu of traditional Level of Service measures. FRA and FTA should consider adopting similar regulatory reforms so that environmental studies truly measure mobility regardless of mode and do not impose unnecessary mitigation requirements.4. Many countries have embraced automatic or one-person train operation on passenger rail or mass transit lines. The United States should do the same.5. The Department should exercise a more common-sense approach to categorization of passenger rail systems as subject to either FRA or FTA regulation. For example the PATH train system in New Jersey and New York is inexplicably subject to burdensome FRA regulation despite being very similar to the New York City Subway which is under FTA regulation. Indeed the risk of triggering FRA regulation has prevented a number of transit projects in the New York area.6. Poorly-designed paratransit regulations impose significant cost burdens. The Department should adopt regulations to clarify that a transit operator required to maintain paratransit operations may satisfy its duties by retaining commercial operators such as Uber or Lyft. ,DOT-OST-2017-0057,"Review of Policy, Guidance, and Regulations Affecting Transportation Infrastructure Projects",Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0057-0035,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2017-06-23T00:00:00-04:00,Joe Sanderson,Comment from Joe Sanderson,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Possible wording would be as follows:Alternate Procedures.  An applicant may propose and the Administration may approve procedures that conform to the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act and the CEQ implementing regulations but do not conform to the provisions of this regulation.  Administration approval shall be subject to concurrence of the CEQ.Rationale:The overall rationale is to create regulatory flexibility that will incentivize better environmental outcomes in return for quicker simpler processes brought about by allowing innovative approaches to be tested on real world projects.As the National Environmental Policy Act approaches 50 years old implementation has standardized with the vast majority of actions being handled quickly and thoughtfully.  Nevertheless the burden on the largest projects those advanced with an environmental impact statement has grown substantially.  New analysis tools and datasets have greatly increased the studies that could theoretically be undertaken and some courts agencies and commenters behave as if more study is always better.  This is not universally true; sometimes time talent and money currently devoted to predictive environmental impact studies would be better devoted to protecting and enhancing the environmental resources affected by major projects and to advancing the projects more rapidly.  No process is immune from further improvement.  Effective improvement often requires real world tests of the proposed changes.  Regulatory authority is needed given the likelihood of any such tests being challenged in court. A simple regulatory provision like this could also jumpstart the regulatory implementation of legislative environmental process changes contained in MAP-21 and the FAST Act without having to flesh out all of the detailed provisions in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and final rule.  FHWA has approved alternate procedures for Title 23 requirements through the Special Experimental Project program.  This regulatory change would give the same opportunity to NEPA related activities.Because this provision requires the development of a thoughtful proposal by the applicant and the approval of FHWA or FTA and is subject to CEQ concurrence there are appropriate safeguards to prevent reckless experimentation with NEPA implementation.Additional Thought:To allow for even greater creativity the CEQ could include a similar regulatory change in its regulation and USACE and EPA could make similar flexibility available in the regulation covering the issuance of 404 permits.One hoped for outcome of this regulatory flexibility is that less money would be spent on environmental documentation and more money would be spent on measures to enhance the environment.

They have implemented a law called the ELD LAW.This law is basically states that all trucks of a 2000 model year or newer have till December 18th this year to equip trucks with a electronic logging device. I understand the concern of the Supreme Court and why they would want such a law to be in effect. Safety is a big issue on Americas roads today. The Fatigued Driving excuse they used to help push this law through is untrue. The (OOIDA) OWNER OPERATORS INDEPENDENT DRIVERS ASSOCIATION Filed an appeal or a request for their appeal to be heard in the Supreme Court. As I understand it the Court's final decision was to basically look past the request of (OOIDA) to appeal the ELD law. The courts denied there request to take it to the court rooms where the voices of American truck drivers voices should have been and needed to be heard. There is alot of controversy when it comes to this ELD Law. Those of you who put this law I to effect with no other reason then to reduce Fatigued drivers on our roads need to look at the actual numbers and causes of most of the accidents on Americas roads that involve a semi truck. 75% of all truck involved accidents on American roadways is due to the driver of the class C vehicle. The exploitation of our nation's Amendment's as well as the Truck Drivers is a disgrace to what we as the backbone of America Sacrifice to make sure the grocery shelves are stocked with food. We ask only to stop being regulated so heavily. We need to look at America's Class C drivers as well. There is no penalties for them when they are involved in the same amount or possibly more accidents then the Professional Drivers. I believe that the Class C Drivers should also much like the Class A commercial Drivers have to take a limited hour class on the dangersdriving conditionsweather conditionsEtc. Etc. The general public needs a class to aquire their license so they may gain awareness of the hazards and dangers of America's roads with a safety course as well to make sure they understand it's importantance of being aware while driving. There is more that can be done to improve the safety of America's roads besides regulating the already over/heavily regulated commercial drivers. I sask you to think about this if you want to improve the ""SAFETY"" of America's roadways DO NOT regulate the hours of commercial drivers with a computer. That is going to do an excessively more amount of damage then it will fixing things. It is not only going to basically force 3.5 million or so American Truck Drivers out of work it is going to effect the roadways themselces. Traffic conditions as well as accidents are honestly going to rise in cities nation wide Because your going to have these drivers on the road all regulated by a computer trying to get through traffic to make an appointment basically forcing them to rush and make mistakes causing more accidents. It is going to force drivers out of the industry as well. You want to regulate Hours Of Service then simply have all your DOT Inspection Stations conduct more logbook inspections. Everyday if every inspection station or weigh station around the country did a mandatory number of logbook inspections everyday there would be less hours of service violations for one for two there would be compliance just as you want. There are other ways to make drivers properly log time as well a run clean hours. Don't out a computer in their trucks because there is heavy talk amongst the trucking community about hanging their keys up and quiting. No one wants to do a job where a computer is telling them what to do all day long. We are truckers because we love the freedom the open road provides us in a way that we do not have to have a boss watching over us all day long. We do not have to work a set schedule. We get to travel and see this beautiful country. There are so many reasons and more we as Americans love what we do despite all we sacrifice to get it done. This Electronic Logging Law takes effect I can promise that there will be a significant loss in jobs for American Truckers. They will quit and not look back. Which will effect the production plants distribution industry. If as many drivers wuit as ar. Estimated then you will have jobs lost everywhere because it will effect everything everywhere. People everywhere will feel the violant sting of loss as the truck drivers who provide their grocery stores food walk away. If we are to be regulated to this extent we might as well not sacrifice our home time our families our lives basically to get it done. We'd rather see our families we'd rather be Home and work a job where we see our kids everyday. This is ridiculous and it's a simple matter of understanding and asking yourself HOW LONG CAN WE PUSH THE TRUCKERS AROUND BEFORE THEY WALK AWAY.?????????",DOT-OST-2017-0057,"Review of Policy, Guidance, and Regulations Affecting Transportation Infrastructure Projects",Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0057-0012,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2017-06-15T00:00:00-04:00,Theodore Abeelen,Comment from Theodore Abeelen,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I do not think the parties who have the responsibility of research have any understanding of the depth of the mistake that is being made with this rule! I will attempt to explain it so everyone can understand .Way back in history there was a LARGE trucking company for a multitude of reasons mostly financial  became a real safety concern to the DOT and congress so they but all their legal beagles to work and after millions of $ of research and litigation they decided they needed some help from some out source Company. So after much more research and development of resources the came upon a small startup in San Diego  Ca. called Qualcomm ..This was a real live TECH think tank doing work for the military NASA and every other industry they could promote a niche in.! The first monitoring mobile system and very smart for a bunch of geeks. They had the forethought to maintain the very cherry of their endeavor every bit of text came back to them and only them ! The demanded that in writing from their own government and that bunch of clowns who were so eager to take Warner to task and get the public off their ass they said sure no problem ! All the while the boys were celebrating for they new they had just struck gold.!! First order of business was to throw together some tracking and info units from units they already had licence for from NASA and Boeing for transponders and engine management consoles and get them loaded up on the offending fleet of commercial trucks.. Qualcomm hit probably the best lick any company could because they had Warner on the hook for the cost of the prototype mobile units and the base system at Warner's headquarters and Qualcomm home offices. In short order they knew what their start up costs were so they did some projections and set up a leasing agreement on all their equipment WA LA.a home run!!!  As time goes by General Motors Ford Motors and every large trucking company in the US Become rental customers for Qualcomm by now they have become huge in the the Transportation Industry of America and on WALL STREET..Here is were things start getting strange a lot of influence in the transportation industry all facets of it a lot of contact with people of influence DOT sees a why to make things easier for themselves  and gain some favor with some certain congressional types  low and behold they create a problem in the trucking industry any way getting of topic here so A while back FMCSA comes up with this ELD system they have dreamed up that is going to fix every thing!  As usual  no one did much research beyond the concept which has its merits but is still flawed. The concept originally centered around the fact that a law enforcement officer or a public safety officer would be required to physically plug in to a receptacle on the vehicle to download the information from the unit makes good sense and about the same coverage they have presently.. Well Guess what that does not gain Qualcomm  one iota of business and this was their idea I can hear the phones humming still and all the COP Unions said hell no this is not any better than it is now !!! Still one entity here is not being addressed at all .here it is in a nut shell The computer controls on these trucks are doing what they designed to do record and store data the problem that is being introduced into the equation is now you THE FMCSA are going to jeopardise not only the trucks security but also the drivers personal  information and also his personal financial information by allowing an outside electronic monitor to search and down load information indiscriminately from that truck REMEMBER all new CREDIT CARDS have chips embedded that can be remotely accessed !!!  Last but not least there are automated repeater systems on the market today for approximately$150.00with $50.00 of modification will do everything that these so called ELD boxes will .

BUT NOT FOR CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES   These standards are currently under legal challenge.The Clean Power Plan rule to reduce CO2 emissions from existing power plants was promulgated by EPA in 2015 for effect in 2022 for existing plants but those rules are under review by EPA AND SHOULD BE RESCINDEDOR which may initiate actions to rescind them by the courts.concerns over whether the erosion of baseload power is compromising a reliable and resilient grid. It also asked whether wholesale energy and capacity markets are adequately compensating attributes that strengthen grid resilience and if not the extent to which that could affect grid reliability and resilience in the future. Indeed a recent National Academies study indicates that there is a growing emphasis within the industry on grid resilience diverse portfolio of generation resources and well-planned transmission investments are critical to meeting regional reliability objectives. A resource portfolio approach is necessary to ensure ERS fuel assurance and flexibility capabilities are available. Conventional generation sources in particular  gas from America public lands  hydropower combustion turbines and steam turbines are currently the chief providers of these attributes. One of the greatest challenges to integrating VRE lies in managing its effects (variability uncertainty location specificity non-synchronous generation and low capacity factor) on grid operations and planning. Lack of long-term forecasting for example increases risks when scheduling planned generation outages and managing severe weather events. There are tradeoffs between multiple desirable attributes for the electric grid. A more reliable and resilient system may be more costly than the least-cost system. Consumer life safety and health are dependent on a reliable and resilient electric grid making the grid a national security asset. Infrastructure hardening with Gas from Public lands  and grid recovery and restoration strategies require advanced planning and investment. In New York and Illinois Clean Energy Standards and associated Zero Emission Credits (ZEC) for nuclear plants are being used to help maintain the economic viability and continued operations of nuclear plants in part to help meet the states' GHG-limiting goals. New environmental regulations and rules from past administration should be rescindedespecially the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) Clean Water Act Section 316(b) and the Coal Combustion Residuals rule. Other contributing factors include more competitive markets and a variety of regional and state-level policies involving costly renewables and flawed carbon pricing. Existing National ambient air quality standards NAAQS for ground level ozone. Analysis suggests that the likely cost to tax payers and business  could be as high as 270 billion per year making the rule the most costly regulation ever issued by EPA.The MATS rule was potentially the most expensive and immediate of the suite of pending regulations ,DOT-OST-2017-0069,Notice of Regulatory Review,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0069-0313,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2017-10-16T00:00:00-04:00,anonymous anonymous,Comment from Anonymous,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However there are portions that need to be reexamined; ie:14hr rule - Drivers need the latitude to be able to stop and rest WITHOUT penalty of the 14hr clock still running. In my opinion the mandated 30 minute break should be a voluntary break it should be extended to 60 min and should NOT be counted as part of the 14hr duty cycle. 34hr reset - This should be a mandatory reset however it should be allowed to be used as needed without specific hours limitations. A drivers lifestyle does not fit in the typical cookie cutter mold as most other occupations.Shipper/Receiver Responsibilities - As entities involved in interstate and intrastate commerce these companies should be held to the same obligations to the regulations as the carriers. The excuse that they are ""private companies"" should not be a limitation on enforcement. We have shippers/receivers that refuse to allow drivers to complete their required breaks and enforcement blames the driver and the carrier.Law Enforcement Responsibilites - As Law Enforcement entities they in fact are Officers of the Court and should not be allowed to force drivers to break the regulations by forcing them to operate over hours when they do not ALLOW a CMV driver to complete his/her break in the Rest Areas or even private parking lots. Police Departments are constantly ordering drivers to leave the rest areas as the State or Local Govt have forbidden overnight parking in the rest area.

That being said if you check the accident records you will see that every since the Court settlement gave Trucking the current Hours of Service ( except the recession years ) accidents have increased each year ! And the last three years if you check you will see that the percentage rise in accidents is almost indentical to the percentage of companies starting to use ELDs ! As the ELDs amplify the FLAWS in the Hours  and this is causing accidents . By forcing drivers to drive when fatigued . If you allowed pictures on here I could post pictures of messages from the same companies pushing ELDs ! That are violating the driver harassment rule the FMCSA put in place to satisfy the court in the lawsuit against ELDs !

David Valadao (CA-21)    of the House of Representatives  formed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Working Group in May 2013 to examine a variety of questions related to ESA implementation.         litigation has increased the federal government's INABILITY  to control catastrophic WILDFIRES.     According to the California Forestry Association environmentalists filed more than 50 appeals in just one county to block thinning projects that sought to protect the Northern Spotted Owl habitat that had been destroyed by fire.   In addition a lawsuit filed by one group led to a federal court order last year that could block state allocation of existing water rights.  The four federal land management agencies (the U.S. Forest Service Bureau of Land Management National Park Service and the FWS) are responsible for managing over 600 million acres of land or nearly one-third of the United States. Decades of failed federal forest management have created unhealthy and overstocked forests placing 73 million acres of National Forest lands and 397 million acres of forest land nationwide at risk of severe wildfire.   Fires are destroying species habitat and ESA itself is creating obstacles that are counter-productive to fighting wildfires including use of heavily mechanized equipment use of aerial retardant and restricted use of water due to concerns about potential impacts to other ESA-listed species such as salmon. State and tribal lands adjoining federal forest lands are increasingly at risk of wildfires partly because of ESA. The Forest Service's self-described ""analysis paralysis"" excessive appeals on timber sales ESA-related litigation statutory and administrative land designations (such as wilderness roadless areas and critical habitat) all serve to delay or outright block management activities necessary to reduce hazardous fuels and improve forest health and habitat. For example in northwestern Montana the Kootenai National Forest Supervisor approved an Environmental Impact Statement to proceed with the Grizzly Vegetation Management project on 2360 acres. The proposed activities included timber harvest fuels reduction prescribed burning pre-commercial thinning wildlife habitat improvement and watershed rehabilitation. In late 2009 several environmental groups filed suit under the ESA claiming these activities would harm grizzly bear habitat. A federal district court judge granted an injunction in 2010 which effectively blocked the management activities and awarded the plaintiff's attorneys' fees in the amount of $56000. This area was recently identified by the National Interagency Fire Center as being at a ""significant risk of wildfire."" Over the past two fiscal years alone  lawsuits notices of lawsuits and appeals were filed in the Idaho and Montana region of the U.S. Forest Service to block timber thinning and other vegetation management in areas at high risk of wildfire.   Endangered species habitat destruction was a reality last year when the Arizona Game and Fish Department noted that two major fires resulted in the destruction of 20 percent of Mexican spotted owl nests known to exist in the world.  In addition biologists scrambled last year to protect endangered fish in New Mexico from the Whitewater-Baldy Complex fire which consumed almost 300000 acres. Chairman Bishop (R-UT) said after the February 5 2016  finalization of a new policy for defining and designating critical habitat under the     Endangered Species Act.  ""Just like we saw with WOTUS this is another power grab.  The new definition injects even more ambiguity and confusion into an already arbitrary process.  This Obama Administration doesn't care if they abuse the law as long as they can exert more control over people.   If we've learned anything from the Obama Administration's handling of the endangered manatee this agenda has nothing to do with improving habitat or protecting species. It's their way to exert more control disguised as helping animals and the environment.""",DOT-OST-2017-0069,Notice of Regulatory Review,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0069-0762,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2017-10-25T00:00:00-04:00,anonymous anonymous,Comment from Anonymous,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Konexial is convinced that the ELD rule will improve safety for the trucking industry and will provide carriers and shippers to gain significant cost savings through Dynamic Load Matching by having the ability to find freight transactions based on geographic and economic shared interest. The ELD rule is the culmination of nearly a decade of work between government business and technology to improve the safety compliance and competitiveness of the trucking industry. The FMCSA has done an admirable job working with carriers to phase in this technology over a 4-year period of time. The industry was given the final rule in December of 2015 which provided 2 years for carriers to plan and implement ELD technology. Further FMCSA granted carriers with older AOBRD technology an additional 2 years (December 2019) to transition to the newer ELD technology and has granted an 8 day exemption for the truck rental and leasing market.The ELD rule has undergone relentless challenge in numerous federal courts including the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which was the most recent court to reject arguments opposing the ELD mandate. The US Supreme Court has also declined to hear any further objections to the ELD rule.The interests of the trucking industry shippers the US economy and the traveling public are all served by the implementation of ELD technology.  The only parties still opposing the ELD rule are those that want the ability to break the Hours of Service rules common to all carriers without being recorded. Konexial stands with the American Trucking Association (ATA) in calling for implementation of the ELD rule as planned for December 18 2017.It's time to move the industry forward.RespectfullyKen EvansCEOKonexial,DOT-OST-2017-0069,Notice of Regulatory Review,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0069-0351,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2017-10-18T00:00:00-04:00,Ken Evans,Comment from Ken Evans,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many in the trucking industry were early adopters of this technology understanding that it brought certainty and consistency to an important safety requirement.  Since the day our company first began implementing electronic logging in 2010 we met with very little resistance from drivers who over time overwhelmingly accepted this tool as a welcome component of their time management and trip planning efforts.  This acceptance continues with existing and newly-hired drivers reinforced by the support shown by our management team to operate both safely and in compliance with hours of service rules.While no system is perfect and that includes electronic logging our experience has shown that ELDs provide the best overall method for managing planning even controlling drivers' hours in ways that ensure we are operating safer and with greater efficiency.  The following bullets make several relevant points in support of this rule and its current implementation schedule:The ELD rule finalized in 2015 simply requires drivers who are currently required to track their Hours of Service to do so electronically instead of on paper logs.Compared to outdated pen and paper methods of tracking driver hours this modern-day technology is more accurate easier to enforce more difficult to falsify and will ultimately save lives.Drivers will benefit from the time savings they will gain from not having to fill out a paper log.A 2014 FMCSA report looking at the benefits of ELD use found that ELD-equipped carriers saw an 11.7 percent reduction in crash rate and a 50 percent drop in hour-of-service violations.Law enforcement including the Fraternal Order of Police the National Sheriffs' Association and the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) have all come out in favor of the rule and strongly oppose any delay in implementation.FMCSA's estimate of a $3.01 billion benefit from this rule resulting from crash reductions and a decreased paperwork burden more than offsets the costs of implementation.  In fact the net benefit of this rulemaking is estimated at $1.18 billion.Congress passed ELD legislation in 2012 so there has been knowledge of this regulation coming for five years and many carriers have already installed ELDs in their fleets in order to comply with the rule.The ELD rule has been upheld by numerous federal courts including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which became the most recent court to reject arguments opposing the ELD mandate to support the ELD final rule.The unfortunate truth of my experience with those opposing ELDs is that much of their reasoning stems from their desire to operate outside legal compliance standards for personal gain.  The arguments aimed at the excessive cost of the technology becomes less relevant with each passing day as competition and innovation are driving down the costs of ELD implementation.  Add to this the savings derived from gained efficiencies the post-implementation reaction of most drivers who find this tool enhances their planning and safety behind the wheel and the substantial number of early adopters who are already reshaping the safety and compliance landscape of our industry and I think the decision to stay the course seems inarguable.

ELDs allow us to easily monitor our dispatch and drivers to ensure compliance and to eliminate the concern of drivers running over hours.  This is a public safety issue and the December mandate needs to be kept.  We have competitors who are running drivers seven days a week with two log books and there if virtually no way for law enforcement to monitor them.

Our members range from self-employed owner operators to some of the nation's largest freight and logistics companies many of which are headquartered in our state. Our Board of Directors first voted to support a federal mandate of electronic recording of hours of service compliance in 1999 and has re-affirmed its position twice since that time.  Because the ELD rule does not place any new regulations on the industry or drivers but instead adopts the use of improved technology to ensure compliance with existing regulations we believe there is significant value to be gained.  ELDs will provide accurate documentation of drivers' hours of service and mitigate safety and compliance risks.  Additionally they remove human error and the ease with which paper logs may be falsified.  The evidence of ELDs' safety benefits compelled Congress to mandate their use in the 2012 MAP-21 transportation legislation with the final rule issued by FMCSA in December of 2015. This rule has widespread industry support with trucking companies across Arkansas and the nation utilizing these devices today. A delay in implementation would unfairly penalize these carriers small and large that were proactive in their attention to safety and preparation for approaching deadlines.  Our industry believes electronic logging devices are essential and that they further our commitment to make America's roads safer. We respectfully urge you to preserve the current deadline of December 18 2017. Primary Reasons to Implement the ELD Rule as Scheduled- The ELD rule finalized in 2015 simply requires drivers who are currently required to track their Hours of Service to do so electronically instead of on paper logs.- Compared to outdated paper-based methods of tracking driver hours this modern-day technology is more accurate easier to enforce more difficult to falsify and will ultimately save lives.- Drivers will benefit from the time savings they will gain from not having to fill out a paper log.- A 2014 FMCSA report looking at the benefits of ELD use found that ELD-equipped carriers saw an 11.7 percent reduction in crash rate and a 50 percent drop in hour-of-service violations.- Law enforcement including the Fraternal Order of Police the National Sheriffs' Association and the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) have all come out in favor of the rule and strongly oppose any delay in implementation.- FMCSA's estimate of a $3.01 billion benefit from this rule resulting from crash reductions and a decreased paperwork burden more than offsets the costs of implementation.

Washington D.C.  - A new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report requested by Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and Senator David Vitter (R-LA) a member of the EPW Committee was released today.  Under various statutes EPA and the Treasury Department are required to reward attorneys' fees to plaintiffs that successfully challenge EPA. Based on a snapshot of EPA's litigation from 1995-2010 the report finds that environmental groups (ENGOs) profited more than any other plaintiff. The report includes litigation costs for all EPA environmental statutes except the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). one litigant-Earthjustice-received $4655425.60 or 32 percent of all attorneys' fees paid to EPA litigants. The GAO report uncovers for the first time the millions of taxpayer dollars that are going to attorneys' fees for environmental litigation against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Yet the report is limited because GAO the government watchdog was unable to obtain information from several federal agencies during the requested time period from 1995-2010. In addition to attorneys' fees awarded the GAO found that the Department of Justice (DOJ) spent at least $43 million in taxpayer dollars defending EPA in court from 1998 - 2010.  Further the report uncovered that most of the attorneys' fees paid to environmental organizations were paid under the Clean Air Act followed next by the Clean Water Act. The report is part of a continued effort by Senators Inhofe and Vitter to ensure greater transparency at EPA. ...... Senator Inhofe: ""Today's GAO report is the tip of the iceberg as we work to get to the bottom of just how many taxpayer dollars are going to pay attorneys' fees in environmental suits.  It is outrageous that these agencies couldn't provide the requested information and it is even more concerning that we have yet to get the full story. lack of transparency on the part of EPA DOJ and the Department of Treasury as GAO was unable to obtain information for several years of litigation payments.  Senator Vitter: ""The GAO report shows that taxpayers have been on the hook for years while 'Big Green' trial lawyers have raked in millions of dollars suing the government.  Even worse because of sloppy record keeping by the EPA and other agencies and a lack of cooperation by the Justice Department we're not even sure how bad the problem really is. This is unacceptable and I'm going to continue working to demand greater transparency."" Government Accountability Office (GAO) uncovered a troubling lack of transparency and accountability in record keeping regarding environmental litigation expenses incurred in EPA litigation. Specifically GAO found: Inconsistent formatting of key data elements produced significant problems for completing our analysis and required significant manual review by GAO and Justice.The Department of Justice does not have a standard approach for maintaining key data on environmental litigation cases and the data they do collect are in two separate databases that do not collect the same type of data on environmental cases. EPA does not track its attorneys' time by case GAO was not able to include data on EPA attorney costs spent on environmental litigation cases. GAO was unable to calculate the total number of hours that Justice Attorneys worked on environmental cases - and hence total costs of attorney time - because the U.S. Attorneys' time is not tracked by case.The Department of Treasury does record data on payments made from its Judgment Fund an account within the Treasury Department authorized under the Equal Access to Justice Act for rewarding attorneys' fees to successful plaintiffs but does not publish them.The government may also incur other costs associated with litigation including the costs of revising regulations in response to lawsuits EPA overhead costs and costs associated with delays in EPA permitting but GAO did not have reliable data to quantify these costs.

Concerns about the appearance of significant influence from special interest and environmental groups in the past Obama administration.   Congress needs to provides a strong foundation upon which America  can build in the fight of special interest groups.  GREATEST PROBLEM AMERICA FACES TODAY IN AMERICA ARE   ENVIRONMENTALISTS   USING THE Endangered Species Act (ESA)  with the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA)  TO STOP BUSINESS AND HUMANS FROM USING THE RESOURCES by   exert more control disguised as helping animals and the environment .

David Valadao (CA-21)    of the House of Representatives  formed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Working Group in May 2013 to examine a variety of questions related to ESA implementation.      Example CALIFORNA  1998 construction of an elementary school in San Diego was delayed by ESA litigation and FWS mitigation requirements to protect a two-inch shrimp. Construction is finally slated to go forward as a result of an agreement by the school district to spend $5 million in ESA mitigation expenses all of which will be passed on to local citizens  EXAMPLE  TEXAS Department of Transportation has been forced to completely redesign the highway project design and submit it for federal approval.  A   spider halted completion of an $11 million water pipeline project.  EXAMPLE MONTANA  a mining project  has been told by the FWS that it will need to pay for contractors to help them complete a biological opinion related to grizzly bears without any assurance the project will be approved.  EXAMPLE UTAH  A rural electric cooperative in Utah was determined that two acres of Utah Prairie Dog habitat were within a 350-foot buffer of the project's right-of-way. This resulted in a nine-month delay ...... Current implementation of ESA does not clearly identify what is needed to recover and delist species resulting in a lack of incentives for state and private conservation costly mandates and wasted resources even in light of increased federal funding. ESA punishes private property owners and water rights holders and fails to properly account for huge economic and regulatory burdens that also hinder species conservation. The ESA also advances the agendas of groups seeking land and water acquisition and control. Working Group Conclusion: The ESA promotes a lack of data transparency and science guiding ESA-related decisions and there are conflicts of interest and bias in ""peer review"" of federal ESA decisions. ESA is increasingly becoming a tool for litigation and taxpayer-funded attorneys' fees. The Obama Administration's use of closed-door settlements undermines transparency and involvement of affected stakeholders and drives arbitrary mandates and deadlines that do little to recover species. In 2012 the Department of Justice (DOJ) provided the House Committee on Natural Resources case information on 613 total cases. ESA shuts out states tribes local governments and private landowners not only in key ESA decisions but in actual conservation activities to preserve and recover species. Congress passing the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA). This act as amended requires among other things that all agencies annually identify and review programs and activities that may be susceptible to significant improper payments.

Many motor carriers have already transitioned to ELDs based on the deadline established by FMCSA.Compared to outdated pen and paper methods of tracking driver hours this modern-day technology is more accurate easier to enforce more difficult to falsify and will ultimately save lives.  TCW has been on electronic logs for 8 years.  We have seen our drivers gain 2.5 hours per week of usable time due to rounding to the nearest minute instead of next 15 minute interval.  Also our operations personnel can use the electronic logs to better schedule our drivers shifts making our drivers more productive.  Also drivers benefit from the time savings they will gain from not having to fill out a paper log.A 2014 FMCSA report looking at the benefits of ELD use found that ELD-equipped carriers saw an 11.7 percent reduction in crash rate and a 50 percent drop in hour-of-service violations.Law enforcement including the Fraternal Order of Police the National Sheriffs' Association and the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) have all come out in favor of the rule and strongly oppose any delay in implementation.FMCSA's estimate of a $3.01 billion benefit from this rule resulting from crash reductions and a decreased paperwork burden more than offsets the costs of implementation.

Since the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001 it has been thought that trucks would be used in subsequent attacks. Electronic Control Modules being readily accessible through wireless internet connections subjects them to remote cyber attacks. Once accessed control can be taken from the driver. Next there are 4th and 5th Amendment rights being violated. The Department of Transportation has admitted that in some cases drivers will be forced to incriminate themselves to law enforcement and company officials a clear violation of the 5th Amendment. Courts have upheld the position that GPS tracking devices placed on a vehicle without a warrant are a violation of 4th Amendment rights. Being shackled with the equivalent of an ankle bracelet without a warrant probable cause accusation or trial is a violation of due process. Not to mention that the large carriers using ELDs are the biggest offenders of highway safety and have proven that falsification of ELDs is not only possible it is common place and are used to harass drivers on a regular basis. Lastly having 24 years experience with 2.75 million miles with no accidents and an impeccable safety and compliance record there is absolutely no positive return on investment. It is more than likely to give a negative return. There is no safety gained by forcing the operator of a commercial vehicle to rush through their day.

When it comes to time sensitive loads ie insects livestock and refrigerated suck as meat seafood and produce it has an expiration date if that elog stops it from getting there fast enough then there's shortages then the government is to blame for it and there will be so many class action lawsuits the government won't have a choice but throw it out anyway so do it now before it becomes a real problem our country has enough problems we don't need more as for safety whether you have an electronic logging book or not does not make a trick safer it actually makes it more unsafe because if the driver gets tired you will be forcing that driver to stove a loaded 80000 pound tractor trailer down the highway tired increasing driver fatigue which can already get a driver a ticket and or put out of service for 10 hours delaying a load again causing shortages of goods and costing us money not to mention the cost to install and pay a monthly service fee like a cell phone for it and whose going to pay that? The driver causing is to loose our income then to add to that we're going to loose on average 1-2 loads a week that adds up to 10-20% of our incomes who is going to pay me the money I'm loosing the government? The fmcsa? The dot? So we're all supposed to take big pay cuts and put up with something originally designed as a punishment for Werner enterprises years ago? How is that right just or fair? It's not and as far as safety goes there's nothing safe about an elog it's already been proven multiple times they can be hacked into just like a computer so that means anyone can manipulate your elog and mess with your entire truck and cause huge problems. So if that happens who is going to pay for the damages? The fmcsa? The government? Probably not this resulting in more class action lawsuits. The rest of the problem with the ""safety"" aspect what happens to the new inexperienced drivers who get caught in bad weather and feel pressured to drive through a white out snow storm and wrecks and hurts or kills people then who is to blame? It will be the government's fault for implementing the law and making that driver feel pressured to drive in unsafe conditions and what about when you get tired and need a nap or need a couple hours extra sleep but you can't because you have a computer telling you when you've had enough rest and it forces you to work straight through your 11 hours when you need to stop and take a nap or fo eat maybe use the restroom but you can't because you got to stay moving because the elog is telling you to your constantly racing that clock which means more speed caused and related accidents are going to happen which means more injuries and fatalities on the road there's nothing safe about it not in any way shape or form. Now when all the shipments are late and there's a shortage of goods the prices for everything are going to go up very very high most people won't be able to keep up  alot of people already can't keep up they struggle and live paycheck to paycheck how do you expect them to keep up with rising costs of everything and if costs go up nobody is going to give us the pay raises to go with it we haven't got a cost living raise in 15 years because everyone keeps taking from the truckers how do you expect us to keep up?

Opposition to this rule seems to be rooted in the fact that the rule by automating the accurate reporting of driving times makes it difficult to ""fudge"" data in order to subvert the existing laws concerning driving and resting times in interstate commerce.I will simply use the summary provided by the American Trucking Associations to make the salient points:The ELD rule finalized in 2015 simply requires drivers who are currently required to track their Hours of Service to do so electronically instead of on paper logs.Compared to outdated pen and paper methods of tracking driver hours this modern-day technology is more accurate easier to enforce more difficult to falsify and will ultimately save lives.Drivers will benefit from the time savings they will gain from not having to fill out a paper log.A 2014 FMCSA report looking at the benefits of ELD use found that ELD-equipped carriers saw an 11.7 percent reduction in crash rate and a 50 percent drop in hour-of-service violations.Law enforcement including the Fraternal Order of Police the National Sheriffs' Association and the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) have all come out in favor of the rule and strongly oppose any delay in implementation.FMCSA's estimate of a $3.01 billion benefit from this rule resulting from crash reductions and a decreased paperwork burden more than offsets the costs of implementation.

It has been on the table and up for discussion openly and transparently for years.

The ELD simply converts what should have been happening with a driver's Hours of Service (HOS) on paper logs into an electronic form.  There has not been a new law passed simply a modernization of how those hours are recorded.  The 'flexibility' that many proponents of a delay wish to use as a rallying cry is in reality - illegal logging of hours - and this creates risk for drivers carriers and shippers.  As a carrier and fleet operator there are many businesses that have not delayed on action to adopt to the new format of logging electronically.  Delaying this implementation will unfairly punish those carriers that were proactive and invested in their businesses.The current push from OOIDA to delay implementation is an end around attempt that is inherently unfair to all competitors in the marketplace and uses hyperbole to undermine the research substantiated in 2014 that found that ELD use reduced crashes by 11.7 percent and saw a 50% drop in hours of service violations.  Law enforcement including the Fraternal Order of Police the National Sheriffs' Association and the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) have all come out in favor of the rule and strongly oppose any delay in implementation as does our organization.FMCSA's estimate of a $3.01 billion benefit from this rule resulting from crash reductions and a decreased paperwork burden more than offsets the costs of implementation.  In fact the net benefit of this rule-making is estimated at $1.18 billion.  I have seen this advantage in my fleet with reduced amount of time for my drivers to record their hours of service as well as back office time of scanning logs reviewing illegible copies and the amount of scanning and storage required.  As for complaints that it will be too expensive or an overall burden financially there are many low-cost solutions that small carriers can employ to be in compliance.Many of the carriers and economic groups that are concerned about the ELD implementation are in the Agriculture transportation sector.  All of the freight that our organization runs is in the Agriculture segment.  There are many customers and carriers that have skirted (at best) the current HOS rules.  Long dwell times and lack of detention pay by the agricultural customers have created a culture in the agricultural transportation world that has led many of the small owner operator businesses to believe that if they lose the 'flexibility' of paper logs there business will not be viable.  As an agricultural shipper who has run ELD's for the past year the reality is that it can be done.  There still needs to be changes in the delays that carriers but higher rates do to long dwell times will help fix that issue.  Free market forces will correct bad behavior from carriers and shippers.Finally Congress passed ELD legislation in 2012 so there has been knowledge of this regulation coming for five years.  OOIDA's (and the many owner operators they represent) claim that they have not had enough time to prepare for this implementation is at its basis a flawed argument.  You don't get to sue over the rule and take it all the way to the supreme court (to not even be heard because there was no merit) and then claim you did not have enough time to prepare for the rule implementation.SincerelyTim SayersCOORFG Trucking Inc.,DOT-OST-2017-0069,Notice of Regulatory Review,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0069-0336,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2017-10-17T00:00:00-04:00,Tim Sayers,"Comment from RFG Trucking, Inc.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The 14 hour clock needs to be removed as it does force drivers into driving beyond their means and abilities. Most of these men and women are not military trained to operate when sleepy or tired. Naps have been proven to help the human body proceed further. The old 10/8 rules was fine and would work just as well with ELoGs. We have more traffic than ever before. Taking naps during peek traffic times is wise. The large carriers and ATA pushed this ELoG and HOS agenda to create a driver shortage beyond what we already had a decade ago. Why? These large companies make more profit with more units on the road. $1 per 30000 trucks a day is a decent profit but you need those 30000 drivers. Hence the push for truck driving schools. I never went to one and didn't have an accident for 16 years. People are being pushed through the schools to fast at the cost of the lives of the motoring public. Think about how bad things got when DOD dropped requirements for enlisting..... lot more lack luster people made it in. Court MArtials went up military members committing crimes went up. Same thing in the Trucking industry when you let just anyone behind the wheel. It takes a certain mindset and dedication for this job. Some are taking it simply because they are to fat to do much else than sit on their butt and hold a wheel. Please consider changing the hours of service. Get rid of the 14 hour rule. Make it where a human can decide when to drive and when to sleep. Keep elogs and make dispatchers and companies accountable if they force a driver to go on with treats. Dispatches should go through the elogs as a record of what is said. I have none of this now. I'm on paper and get my stuff via email.

529,DOT,FALSE,0,2017-12-01T23:59:59-05:00,2017-10-02T00:00:00-04:00,In retrospect and 41 years of experience in the world of trucking as an owner and driver with close to 5 million safe miles in the USA I have a profound knowledge of safety and enjoying a successful career through many stages of the federal guides of law.I appeal to the agencies of law making on Electronic Logging Devices to consider my humble opinion of the devices on the merrits of safety and national productivity with elimination of vehicle movement recording of non highway maneuvers on private property. Those movements recorded will effectively reduce highway use taxes from on highway truck mileage loses. The result is billions of tax dollars lost to the highway fund. Imagine each truck every week losing 400 taxable highway miles over millions of trucks.1 hour over 8 days is a loss of at least 400 miles. The 70 hour 8 day rule reduced to 62 as a result. Less national productivity.An alternative solution that would retain safety and help prevent national revenue losses in operating a commercial vehicle would be to offer tolerance of movement while under dispatched service that is not on the regulated highways. Many movements such as checking in then staging on private property for dock assignment sliding tandems 2 feet to accommodate docking and weight balance of load and scaling are in addition to the already check in and dock maneuver normally logged as functions made capable of enforcement. I feel a proximity range should apply for movement of at least one half mile tolerance be an exemption from on duty logging. Proximity tolerance would allow for less logistical errors on economic needs and more on time delivery of supply chain. The hours of service in accordance with the implied safety merits of the old 15 hour rule were in my opinion vastly better than the 14 hour rule of today. My reasons are not because one was 15 hours and the other is14 hours of today but in the virtue of flexibility comparison. The 15 hour was based on the ability to break the hours and not force duty time all into a lump time. Flexibility to do the same duty hours according to human needs in my honest opinion leads to safer operation of the vehicle. A split sleeper rule and split driving rule was used effectively to work with a human need to sleep when tired. Some drivers planning to deliver on time would use that allowance to avoid high traffic volume in metropolitan areas and travel safer without delay of rush hours to make delivery on time. Flexibility options aren't allowed in the current law pushing the 14hr. duty time all at one time. The ELD under the current rule will try to regulate a human into a machine world. The truck is a machine it never gets tired in 14 hours straight. A human driver however yes he does and should be left self regulated as was done with the 15 hour rule. Only the driver knows his physical limitations the ELD and current rule it monitors does not.Solutions for the hours of service in the event of the ELD law implementation should allow for the ability of the driver to determine safety and security in parking by the ability to break up the hours of rest and work to accommodate sensible essential life functionality and general safety of the public. I would suggest a provision for an even split of duty and off duty sleeper rest. A provision of such would allow seeking a safe and legal place to park uninterrupted as oppossed to forced illegal parking as often a result of forced hours of service restrictions of the 14 hr. rule.Regardless of the nature of the commodity hauled there should never be a freight that supercedes the safety of the public. I therefore disagree strongly with exemptions of hours of service for any freight or commodity over another under normal commerce. Situations of national security and disaster recovery are however vital and as such should be exempt temporarily by order of state governments and ordered exempt through FEMA. Those shipments should pass unencumbered by laws governing hours of duty but escorted by enforcement agencies.There are many good merits to the function of the ELD. It has the potential of being a time saving tool as I have experienced through the use of one personally in my business. There are no pens no rulers and no illegible marks as on paper logs. Paper logs are subject to inadvertent mistakes of entry requiring corrections that take time. The ELD is always monitoring location and time which reduces errors in geography and clock entries therefore increases driver available duty and commodity movement. It would be a negative if all those attributes which the ELD gives was taken away by micro management of duty movement on private property customers and truck stops.Other concerns Cyber security danger of hacking ECM control. National security Tension between freight forwarding and drivers from delays and ELD duty limits.

530,DOT,FALSE,0,2017-12-01T23:59:59-05:00,2017-10-02T00:00:00-04:00,"  What is an ELD? It is an electronic logging device that was designed to micromanage large fleets and their drivers performance and productivity.   These devices are to be used as a device for logging a drivers daily hours. Driving time on duty not driving time sleeper berth and off duty. Drivers are afforded a 14 hour day to work. Of that 14 hours they are limited to 11 hours driving. They must also take a mandatory 30 minute ""break"" in the first 8 hours. When the 14 hours are up they are required to take a 10 hour break. Once the clock starts; it doesn't stop for anything. How is this wrong one might ask. Before the straight 14 hour rule; drivers had what was known as split sleeper berth. More rested and safer.  The reason the ELD was developed was because certain large carriers had such horrible safety records the government said they ""had to do something"" to improve their records. These companies safety records are still horrible by the way. How do they ""improve"" their safety records? Well for them they purchase excess equipment keep it legally registered and your accident ratio drops per 100 or 1000.   Being self insured allows the mega carrier to hire freshly graduated students from trucking schools (10 days to 4 weeks training). They then place the graduates with less than all seasons experienced trainers. (4 months in some instances). They then place these ""teams"" on the highways with the general public. This is a recipe for disaster.  An organization known as the ATA (which stands for American Trucking Association) lobbied for this mandate. This organization claims to be the ""authoritative voice of the trucking industry"". While in actuality they represent less than 20% of the industry. The other 80% is comprised of small business owners. (1-20 trucks). They pushed the mandate through under claims of safety. This device has nothing to do with safety. It only monitors what the truck is doing. The safety of the vehicle relies solely on the operator.   How is this an unjust law? It targets owners of vehicles with engines manufactured after a certain date. It has exemptions. These ""exemptions"" alone are proof that the mandate is flawed.   This mandate is an infringement (borderline at the very least) on the 4th and 5th Amendment rights of the constitution of the United States. It places a ""proverbial"" electronic tracking device on your vehicle. The Supreme Court ruled that this practice was not lawful in cases against convicted criminals. Yet they can do it to truckers. (The Supreme Court refused to hear the case).   How do you ensure a multi billion dollar industry will be successful? You mandate it. Then you collect money from hard working men and women to fund it. There are 3.97 million trucks on the highways. Take a conservative figure of 3 million. Then use an average monthly service fee of $32. Multiply those two figures and it equates to $96 million. Multiply that by 12 and you get in excess of 1 billion dollars. That is just for the service fee per year.  This mandate places an unnecessary expense on certain truck owners. Again making it an unjust law.   The ATA with no factual proof estimates that these devices will save 26 lives per year. This estimate is within the margin of error in any poll of 1000. With no factual proof; these devices cannot be referred to as safety items. Remember they are micromanagement tools.   In the passing of this mandate; the government has taken business decisions and freedoms away from small business owners. Now the government wants to micromanage them.   It is a fact by their own statistics that 80% of all accidents involving commercial vehicles and automobiles are caused by the automobile. This was the finding of both the ATA and NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). Yet the trucking industry is punished for them.   There are concerns of cyber security associated with the devices. These units plug in to the ECM of the vehicle. (Electronic control module). This gains the device access to all of the vehicle's functions. The device has the capability to send and receive messages. Can the device be hacked? Why would anyone want to? 80000lbs is a large projectile. Especially if it's a HazMat load. Maybe just a desirable commodity.   It would be better served for safety sake to mandate that ALL vehicles be required to be equipped with breathalyzers and data suspension devices. (Hands free calls only). There would quite possibly be tens of thousands of lives saved on the highways per year.   How do you think you would feel if your vehicle were being electronically tracked 24/7? Without a warrant not committing a crime. Just being tracked. Then at your expense you would feel your rights and freedoms had been violated.  In closing I would like to add that this mandate was never about safety. Moreover about money and control.",DOT-OST-2017-0069,Notice of Regulatory Review,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0069-2589,Posted,Public Submission,1,TRUE,NA,2017-11-28T00:00:00-05:00,Riley Clay,Comment from Riley  Clay,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The specific reference that I am commenting on is:  The ELD mandate due to be implemented 12/18/2017 (49 CFR 395 Subpart B).2.)  The regulation is burdensome because:       a) ELD's strictly enforce the Hours of Service Rules (HOS) which are inflexible and cause drivers to rush against at least 4 different clocks adding to drivers' stress levels.  The driver of an 80000# vehicle should not feel stressed and/or rushed nor feel they have to continue driving when tired in inclement weather in rush hour traffic etc. HOS regs do not take into account lengthy detentions at shippers and receivers shortage of safe truck parking and it could take YEARS to change the HOS rules due to numerous back and forth lawsuits between the FMCSA and safety advocacy groups such as Public Citizen and Parents Against Tired Truckers.b) Carriers see drivers' available driving hours and location and can then harass and coerce drivers to drive when they do not feel capable of doing so safely. c) Small carriers and owner operators have very slim profit margins.  The costs of purchasing ELD equipment and monthly subscriptions could make the difference between being able to continue doing business or being forced out of business.  In addition subscribers are at the mercy of the ELD vendors.  If they decide to raise subscription rates exorbitantly the carrier/owner operator has no choice but to comply or switch vendors at additional cost.d) Vendors are allowed to ""self-certify"" and FMCSA has not evaluated and/or verified the reliability or level of compliance of any vendors' products.  If the product ends up malfunctioning regularly or causes damage to the electronics of CMV's purchasers are forced to absorb those costs and repair CMV's and find a replacement ELD product. Drivers found to be out of compliance on HOS regulations due to malfunctioning ELD's will still be assessed points on their and their carrier's CSA records.e) ELD's provide a wireless link to the CMV's ECM posing a risk to national security.  Please read the following article where a group of researchers at the University of Michigan were able to hack and control a big rig's acceleration and braking.  The semi in the study was hard wired but ELD's bypass that necessity.  https://www.wired.com/2016/08/researchers-hack-big-rig-truck-hijack-accelerator-brakes/f) Small carriers and specifically owner operators will likely see a 30-50% reduction in revenue and a reduction in time at home as well leading to more stress and frustration.  Fuel expense will be increased for owner operators when they feel the need to drive the full speed limit instead of driving safe comfortable economic speeds.g) Many owner operators are purchasing trucks with pre-1999 engines.  This will affect safety (older parts that may fail more often) and the environment.h) Many experienced and safe owner operators are deciding to get out of trucking altogether.  Statistics prove that this segment of drivers are the safest on the roads and possess the best maintained equipment.  Large carriers are implementing programs to hire 18-20 year olds and foreigners to replace the mature experienced responsible safe drivers that may leave due to ELD's.i) The ELD mandate is a $2 billion unfunded mandate See the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995.  No real cost benefit analysis was performed.  FMCSA estimates 26 lives per year will be saved but when the previous considerations I mentioned are included in a study I would guess that substantially more lives will be lost due to this burdensome regulation.j) The numerous associations and corporations that are requesting exemptions from this failed mandate are a clear sign that this industry CAN NOT be painted with a wide brush.  The HOS rules are unsafe and unrealistic and ELD's enforcement of them will cause many more problems than they solve.k) ELD's are an invasion of drivers' privacy period! They were originally a punishment for carriers with many HOS violations. The industry as a whole should not be punished due to a few bad actors!3.  Alternative(s) to this burdensome regulation are:  a) ELD's should be delayed AT LEAST until HOS can be changed to reflect common sense flexibility and address the many variables in the different segments of the trucking industry.  b) The 14 hour clock needs to be able to be stopped for certain circumstances.  c) Shipper and receiver delays should not count against a driver's on duty time since most times the driver climbs into the sleeper bunk anyway.  d) My thought is that in any given 24 hour period a driver should be allowed x amount of hours for driving sleeping on duty not driving etc. and be allowed to break it up any way that he/she sees fit.  These changes would allow much more flexibility and lead to safer less stressful economically feasible driving.",DOT-OST-2017-0069,Notice of Regulatory Review,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0069-1943,Posted,Public Submission,1,TRUE,NA,2017-11-21T00:00:00-05:00,Christi Davenport,Comment from Christi Davenport,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is being pushed by the ATA because the mega carriers want to put the small guys all out of business; this is what it is intended for.  The added cost of ELDs are easily absorbed for the mega carriers but it is an added burden on the small independent carriers in an industry that is already nickel and diming us every day.Forcing all Truck Drivers to be GPS tracked with ELDs/EOBRs is a gross violation of our 4th amendment rights. The Supreme Court has ruled twice that it is a violation of privacy rights granted in the 4th amendment. Truckers haven't done anything wrong we should not be tracked like criminals. The ELDs have been proven to be high risk for hacking and cyber attacks. Lets be real while I always follow the hours of service rules there are times that there is a need for flexibility. Sometimes situations out of our control means we need an extra 10 minutes to get to a safe parking spot or our clock runs out wile getting loaded and the shipper says we need to get off the property or you my find yourself in an ice storm. ELDs will not allow that flexibility and will push drivers into making dangerous decisions out of fear of HOS violations instead of putting their personal and public safety first.THE PEOPLE MAKING THESE RULES GO HOME EVERYDAY.

What it will do is cost billions to implement and a billion dollars a month in user fees.  As long as the device is only capable of recording when the vehicle is moved and only when it is moved that is the only part of the record that can be sure to be accurate. ON Duty. Off duty and sleeper berth time can easily be and are regularly falsified by drivers using elds. The agency claims 26 lives will be saved per year. You could save twice as many by pulling the operating authority of any of the top 3 mega carriers on the accidents per 10k miles traveled list. When your own stats show that cars cause over 80% of car vs truck accidents are caused by cars I believe you are 100% focused on the wrong drivers.  I honestly see no chance that the savings in lives and injuries will happen because your own stats show accident rates climbing the last several years and eld usage has been climbing at the same time. Speaking personally I have been using an eld for 18 months now. In my 22 year career I have never felt more rushed been more stressed or been less patient with either the general public or my fellow drivers.As for things that could actually solve a few of these issues lets start with driver training. There is no reason that mega carriers should be getting waivers for learners permit holders to drive a cmv unsupervised. NONE. The same carriers getting these waivers are turning out dangerously undertrained operators to use the same roads our families use. There should be a minimum number of driving hours logged AFTER being licensed before a driver can operate a tractor trailer alone. An apprenticeship program if you will.  Second the split sleeper berth provision in the current HOS is nearly useless as written. Requiring 8 continuous hours in the sleeper to use it means for me sleeping 5-6 hours then staring at the walls till the clock says it is ok to work again.  Most drivers I know haven't slept 8 hours at a time in decades. For most of us a split of 6-4 or 5-5 or 7-3 would actually work and allow us to do common sense things like stop and rest to miss rush hour or wait out a heavy rain storm. Coupled with a 14 hour clock that only a minimum 8 hour stop can pause the current regulation tie drivers hands and force us to operate in more risky conditions rather than allow us to make decisions based on years of experience and sound judgement.Last the ""safety advocates"" you bring into the rulemaking process seem to fall into only a few categories.  Groups funded by mega carriers looking to squash the small businessman groups funded by railroads looking to put all trucking at a competitive disadvantage and groups that sell hardware and services that the regulation would require looking to make a buck.  The ATA doesn't speak for drivers. They speak for our corporate overlords who want to track our every move but want to be able to say ""we don't want to have to track you but the government makes us"". What you seek to require is a level of tracking the courts don't allow to be used on convicted felons without a warrant yet we are charged with no crime. We are not criminals we are hard working family men and women. No one wants highway safety more than us. No one spends more time on those highways than us and we all want to live.",DOT-OST-2017-0069,Notice of Regulatory Review,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0069-2117,Posted,Public Submission,1,TRUE,NA,2017-11-21T00:00:00-05:00,Patrick Valenti,Comment from Patrick Valenti,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Minimum training standards need to be enforced for all companies especially those with their own driving schools which need to be eliminated.  Along with mega carriers being able to self insure. Those three things would eliminate many accidents involving trucks. Many of which are due to smaller cars and inexperienced drivers. Furthermore if FMCSA is persistent in pursuing electronic logging devices there will be a federal lawsuit over our rights to not be tracked electronically since they have no warrant and we are not under suspicion of a crime. If FMCSA is serious about changing hours of service both to suit drivers needs and the safety of the public they need to eliminate the 14 hour call on our clock and go back to allowing split sleeper birth times. This eld mandate does nothing for safety and is nothing more than a blatant overreach of federal regulation and ATA funded theivery. If FMCSA is serious about safety then start passing common sense regulations.

We have a combined 60 years of trucking experience between my partner and myself.  With all this experience we cannot determine how the ELD mandate will increase safety at all!! or save ONE life.  this mandate is another example of big business trucking pushing their will on the entire trucking industry.  We have seen with the flawed CSA scoring system that the industry is not a one size fits all.  This mandate is putting undo burden and expense on small business owners to do exhaustive research and training in an industry that is already chocked full of regulations.     Every stat the FMCSA comes up with is created to fit their agenda.  The real stats should be taken from the small business' across the country that rely solely on themselves to practice safety thus ensuring a job for their families.    This mandate along with the self insured capabilities of the mega carriers will push many hard working groups out of the industry in turn monopolizing trucking over time.  This mandate infringes on my first amendment right of free speech as I can communicate my compliance of hours of service on paper instead of electronically..

Environmental activist groups like NRDC are integral to green litigation and lobbying machine while simultaneously serving as close allies and partners with the Obama EPA to advance a shared mission. June 25 2013 Obama announced a plan to have the U.S EPA or Agency issue rules under section 111 of the Clean Air Act to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Committee's oversight into these rules and role NRDC played in developing the proposed rules which rebuts much of the Obama Administration's narrative about how these rules were developed. Report documents previously unknown details about relationship between EPA and environmental activist groups and ""sue-and-settle"" process that led to these rules. 2015 EPA released its final rules regulating carbon emissions from power plants. EPA efforts to regulate carbon emissions from power plants were driven by Obama Administration officials and ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST groups who worked to fulfill Obama climate commitments pages 15-17 29 5056. EPA rushed into a ""sue-and-settle"" agreement with Natural Resources Defense Council other environmental activists and several state and local governments in 2010 to issue unprecedented carbon regulations with LITTLE REGARD to the technical legal and policy challenges that rules would present. pages 14-19 21 26 30-39 45-48 5661. EPA played politics with regulatory process by trying to manipulate rulemaking deadlines to avoid a public backlash close to 2012 Presidential and 2014 midterm elections and to push implementation to next Administration pages 16 17 31-34 40-49 5564. The carbon rules were the product of quintessential ""sue-and-settle"" scheme where EPA and environmental activists such as NRDC continued to negotiate BEHIND CLOSED DOORS changing regulatory actions and deadlines without providing the public meaningful notice or opportunity to comment. pages 17-19 24 26 3140-45 Obama EPA officials repeatedly MISLED the American people news media and Congress about negotiations with environmental activists and contribution made by these activists to development of carbon rules. pages 4-643 47 48 54 62-6467. The White House EPA and environmental activists worked together to manage the public message on the carbon rules. pages 28-29 33-35 39 46 47 50-51 5468. The litigation settlement provided environmental activists significant leverage to drive timing of EPA's rulemaking and to influence scope of its policies.pages 30-32 35 40-46 67 EPA's process for developing the carbon rules appears to have DEVIATED FROM THE AGENCY STATUTORY AUTHORITY under the Clean Air Act and established policies and circumvented transparency laws and public participation requirements. pages 22 23 28 32 43 48-49 62-64. NRDC and other environmental activist groups have worked with EPA to shore up the shaky basis for carbon rules issuing public statements criticizing opponents of rule and submitting detailed legal analyses for EPA to rely on and cite in its rulemaking documents. pages 59-68 . EPA and environmental activists had cozy relationships and egregiously used personal emails and held meetings away from EPA headquarters thereby avoiding public transparency. pages 20 22 25 28 39 43 4854-56. In addition to detailing overt ""sue-and-settle"" tactics Report reveals how environmental activist groups including Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and EPA INAPPROPRIATELY coordinated a public message on climate. The Administration went out of its way to mislead the American public about the timing and scope of these rules stating repeatedly that it had ""no plans"" to regulate existing power plants even though it had been working behind scenes with its environmental allies to do it. Only after his reelection did Obama intervene to set in motion EPA action that would fulfill his original climate campaign promises before leaving office. Environmentalists proved to be big cheerleaders for Obama and EPA but groups such as NRDC were basically an extension of the Agency providing policy advice data and modeling legal counsel.

Everyone has different sleep patterns and no one rule can change that or make it safer. The ELD violates privacy rights as the supreme court themthemselves has ruled on per tracking without a warrant.  I think SELF insurers should be done away with so the DOT can see the real accident RATES of companies not just the ones they choose to report. This is a revenue problem that the large companies are trying to solve through the lobbying of the ATA (just look at their 5 yr annua revenuel reports) none of which have any experience behind the wheel of a semi truck. I mind you it all looks good on paper but at some point practical applicati9j has to take the place of information and the real world application does not account for all of the daily hurdles faced in the industry. There are also questions of safety and the ability to be hacked as the University of Michigan pointed out in a study done where they were able to control the trucks wirelessless while the driver was driving.  This could be the single largest threat to the US in a way like no other the scenarios are endless and very disturbing to think about. More truck WITH ELDS WRECK THAN WITHOUT them which was also proven by the DOT data. You want safety then correct the environment the drivers have to work in. Correct the class D DRIVERS abilities and make test more thorough to pass and require more conditions to be set. The Class D DRIVERS have no skill to control or maintain when in danger nor do they understand the danger they put everyone else in. ,DOT-OST-2017-0069,Notice of Regulatory Review,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0069-1673,Posted,Public Submission,1,TRUE,NA,2017-11-16T00:00:00-05:00,Damon Sorrells,Comment from Damon Sorrells,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Hours of Service should be placed upon the drivers and not the equipment.  It is amazing that the FMCSA has decided that without looking into the possibility of my equipment being hacked and controlled that they have required these wireless devices to be placed on our equipment.  Not only do you desire to have them placed upon our equipment creating a dangerous environment that is beyond my control you expect my company to pay for the ELD's.  Why do you want access to more information than needed?  You can accomplish an ELD program without attaching to our equipment ECM's then there would be no violation of my property ownership rights otherwise you are infringing upon my rights for property ownership and using the information for public use without any compensation for such.  This is a violation of Amendment 5 of the Constitution of the United States.I wonder why the FMCSA wants to track the ECM and actions of my equipment?  Should you not be wanting to just stay focused on the drivers and HOS issues.  It is the DOT officers job to inspect the safety and quality of my equipment not an electronic tracking device.  I would much rather have human eyes on my equipment vs electronic eyes.  Human eyes can see things that are dangerous to the motoring public that the ELD or ECM will never see.  ELD's in effect is not fixing the safety issues that run amuck on our highways.  Better training and cutting subsidies to the Mega-Carriers for their substandard training programs would be a better start.  When we encourage companies to put out a puppy mill style training program and give them exemptions for doing such along with government kickbacks in the form of subsidies we then know why we have the problems that we currently have.Let us talk about HOS for a second.  The current HOS is a joke to say the least.  Drivers should have the choice for flexible hours of service this will allow them to adjust their 11/14 hour day within reason.  Which driver is safer?  The one that runs 11/14 straight through day after day?  The driver that would be allowed to split their shift as follows 7 hours working 3 hours off 7 hours working 7 hours off.  What about this driver?  5 hours working 5 hours off 5 hours working 5 hours off.  I believe by allowing drivers the opportunity to pause their working clock as the environment allows will help keep drivers from running stressed and fatigued.  Drivers will make better decisions as to when they should run in rush hours conditions or weather conditions.  Not all drivers are alike the FMCSA along with their friends at the ATA seems to believe that making drivers prisoners in a box is the answer.  This is idiotic to say the least it would be like telling all Americans starting Dec 18 2017 everybody needs to sleep and work the exact same time or telling everybody that they must wear the same size clothes or they would be punished.  The FMCSA has been doing this for years without even acknowledging their own statistical reports.  Just what in the heck are we spending all this money for?  If you do not even pay attention to your own studies.There should be no exceptions to the rules regardless of company size.  Why are we running a skewed CSA system instead of showing the public the true accidents and Haz-mat violations.  It sure seems that the current ELD mandate HOS and system are rigged in the favor of the Mega-Carrier.  Spending money on studies that can be fixed with the true stakeholders involved would result in a safer industry.  Small Motor Carriers deserve representation and involvement with the FMCSA on these issues.  We would like to have an equal voice in the regulations that affect our industry.  I would prefer to work with the FMCSA instead of against them too bad they do not seem to feel the same.  See you in court later next year FMCSA.Summary:The ELD needs to be on the drivers and not the equipmentA flexible hours of service plan needs to be addressed that uses logic and safety as the foremostRequiring a better training plan for new drivers needs to be establishedThere should be no exceptions to the rules regardless of company sizeWe need to show the accident and Hazmat violations once again instead of the skewed CSA scoring systemWorking together willingly with the FMCSA would be preferred by the majority of small motor carriers vs. working against one anotherThe FMCSA does not have the right to violate property ownership rights of any citizen of the United States.

But right ""now"" it is foolish to force this upon us.1) It is costing small business and owner operators a larger headache than mega carriers are having to face. Mega carriers brought ELDs upon their own heads by abusing the system and pushing their drivers too hard. We should not be punished for their criminal activities. The FMCSA following the ATAs bidding at this point is pathetic.2) This new ELD system not only can but certainly will introduce cyber security vulnerabilities to the network/transportation grid that will be used by our enemies to cause confusion and even paralysis of logistics and Hours of Service recording. At the push of a button viruses can be introduced into the system crippling it for days weeks months at a time. If you don't listen to what I'm trying to explain I would like to assure the FMCSA that they will be forced to observe it when competing nations like Russia India China and North Korea wreak havoc on the backbone of United States industry. And when it happens the American people will know you were warned and chose to move forward with this recklessness anyway.3) The ELD installation and operation itself comes with a sharp learning curve for some of our most experienced professional senior drivers and it is going to push many of them out of the industry by frustration and lack of technical knowledge alone. We NEED these drivers not only to keep this nation supplied and breathing but their skill in operating these vehicles needs to be handed down to the next generations. Why do ANYTHING that would force them out? This is irrresponible and again the consequences are not being considered here.4) You are setting the stage to be sued in Federal Court because of your unwillingness to listen to contradicting opinion on this matter by the people who matter most in it. This is not becoming of a democratic society. In fact this is not only compiling information on the activities of the American people it is also an invasion of privacy. I pay for this truck. It is my personal property and an extension of my home. The Constitution of the United States expressly forbids what the FMCSA is inflicting upon my person my rights and my way of life.5) Finally these ELDs add yet another twist of pressure to make driving commercial vehicles as much a pain as humanly possible. The corporate effort of the ATA is to gradually push human priority out of the operation of these trucks and introduce ""autonomous technology"" to fill in for a ""driver shortage"" that THEY created. And they are doing this to dodge liability in the industry reduce the money they spend on payroll and benefits and effectively increase their profits while turning our highways into a nightmare.Respectfully if the FMCSA doesn't want to be held 100% accountable for this when it comes to light (and in today's political climate it WILL come to light) then I suggest they stop playing the part of the ATA's lobby-tools and start cracking down on said companies of the ATA for an attack on American industry; an attack designed to further secure corporate monopolies and intentionally drive millions of citizens out of work.These highways are in our blood. These cities are our people. These trucks and supplies are this nation's backbone.

I am requesting a waiver of the deadline forcomments as such death precipitated by the rules being addressed in thisDocket took place after the first comment period closed. In addition I petition the DOT to stop allowing ""involuntary denied boarding"":airlines should be held to the same standards of any other business includingcontract law and customer protection. If an airline wishes to overbook economic damage should dictate how much tocompensate fliers whose contracts have been unilaterally breached.The death of Carol Anne Gotbaum should energize everyone at the DOT to make thesituation right for flyers to come.Washington PostA DEATH FORETOLDWhy Flying Now Can KillBy A.L. BardachSunday October 14 2007; Page B01 I am haunted by the death of Carol Anne Gotbaum.I didn't know the mother of three who died shackled to a bench in the Phoenixairport on Sept. 28 en route to an alcohol treatment center in Tucson. I don'tknow beyond what I read in the newspapers what troubles weighed on her. But Ido know this: Based on my own recent flight experiences hers was a death foretold.There's every reason to believe that Gotbaum would be alive today if she hadbeen allowed to board her flight to Tucson and take her rightful seat. While hertragedy has been a Page One story in many newspapers few reports have focusedon the fact that the airlines involved US Airways and its subcontractor MesaAirlines are notorious for overbooked flights. According to the New York TimesUS Air had revenue last year of $11.56 billion. Of that $1 billion was theresult of diligent overbooking.The stressful often incendiary situations created by overbooking infuriateperfectly healthy well-adjusted passengers. It's not hard for me to imaginethat an emotionally fragile vulnerable person like Gotbaum could have feltabsolutely desperate.Gotbaum wasn't late for boarding. She didn't forfeit her place by ignoring theairline's procedures. Her only mistake was showing up at the US Airways gate andbelieving that her paid-in-full reserved-seat airline ticket meant that shewould actually have a seat on the plane.We made the same mistake. In May I was to give a speech in Washington. I wasrecovering from a health problem so I asked my husband to accompany me on thetrip. A plane ticket was purchased for me on US Air. It wasn't a cheap ticket;together the cost of our flights came to close to $1500.Bob and I had never flown US Air before and we just laughed when the friend whodropped us off at the Santa Barbara airport barked ""Don't do it. It's the worstairline in the history of aviation."" But then we saw the long snaking lines atthe counter which was attended by just two employees.When we finally reached the counter a half-hour later the ticket agent told usthat the plane had been overbooked and that there were no seats for us. Iexplained that I had an appointment in Washington and was also dealing with ahealth issue. To our surprise the staff who seemed exhausted and overwroughtwere not especially sympathetic: The flight was overbooked they said andthat's all there was to it.What I didn't know then but learned later is that many of US Air's flights aresubcontracted to the ultra-economy Mesa Airlines. Both Mesa and US Air are basedin Arizona and Mesa we would learn is famous for its penny-pinchingunderstaffing ways. My husband and I as well as Carol Gotbaum were dealingwith Mesa personnel although the airport signs were for US Airways.Initially we were told that we were being denied boarding because we had boughtour tickets on the Internet. But that wasn't true. Then the counter person saidthat we were the last to check in when in fact there were half a dozen peoplebehind us -- also with reserved seats. Finally one staffer leveled with us andsaid: ""Look they [US Air] overbook all of our flights."" Not only could we notget on our flight but the next flight was also overbooked and the one afterthat. There was simply no guarantee that we'd be able to get out that day.Other passengers stepped up to help. Three people who were traveling on vacationoffered to switch with us preferring to get a free plane ticket forvolunteering to be bumped. But we watched incredulously as the Mesa counterpersonnel talked each one out of switching with us. Much the same thing happenedto Carol Gotbaum.A great deal has been made of the fact that she was on her way to an alcoholrehab center but no one has come forward to say they saw her drinking that day.The only difference between her and us was our reaction. We didn't lose controlbut we were plenty steamed. When we learned that all the flights had beenoverbooked my husband confronted the counter staff while I sat down and cried.That's why I can imagine the desperation the situation would evoke in someonewho was ill disabled or distraught. I only had to get to Washington for aconference; Carol Gotbaum's health and life depended on her getting to Tucson.We eventually made it to Washington after Mesa/US Air dispatched us to anotherairport 100 miles away in a speeding taxi. The experience however stayed withus for a long time afterward especially as we experienced more overbookingproblems -- as well as lost luggage delays and rerouted flights -- on every legof our trip to and from Washington.At various airports I interviewed any US Air/Mesa staffers who would talk tome. On one flight segment we sat with several Mesa/US Air staff members and apilot and heard quite an earful. This small group said that to increaseprofitability Mesa understaffs all its sales counters baggage staff and otherpersonnel and slashed health care and pensions while US Air overbooks allflights and often issues duplicate seat assignments. We learned that the staffand the pilots were virtually at war with Mesa's chief executive JonathanOrnstein. We listened as one flight attendant told us that they have schemed anddreamed of ""flying over his home and dropping the lavs"" referring to theairplanes' toilets. The pilot told us they were terribly underpaid andoverworked and that flying conditions were unsafe. Some pilots he said madeonly $19000 a year and did not have adequate training.Other staffers told us that many US Air/Mesa personnel were dispirited andoverworked which often led them to vent their frustration on passengers in asort of ""kick the dog"" syndrome especially in Phoenix. One flight attendantsaid she had once seen five people arrive a few minutes late at the Phoenixcounter and be denied the right to board even though the flight attendants andpilot were willing to allow them on. In this rare case the plane was notoverbooked and the passengers' seats were available. Still the counter staffwouldn't let them board.Some of what we heard from such disgruntled personnel was later confirmed in theNew York Times. On May 30 the newspaper ran an article looking behind thescenes at the airline practice of overbooking in which US Air figuredprominently. It quoted a US Airways official as saying that employees called insick because they didn't want to deal with overbookings and a Boston gate agentcomplained ""You know you're going to be yelled and screamed at to the point youhave to call the police.""But what about the passengers? US Air has said that it gave away Gotbaum's seaton a connecting flight because she arrived at the gate with only 25 minutes --instead of 30 -- to spare. But she had already checked in for that flight atJohn F. Kennedy airport in New York. You don't have to check in again in theconnecting city as I understand US Air's regulations. The rules as posted onthe airline's Web site also state ""Reservations are subject to cancellation ifyou are not checked in and at the departure gate at least 15 minutes prior todeparture."" Gotbaum was still covered. She'd left 25 minutes to spare.Still she was denied her reserved seat on the 1:30 flight. Nor did they allowher to board the next flight at 2:58 -- which of course was also overbooked.Finally Mesa's counter personnel refused to let willing passengers switch withthe clearly distraught Gotbaum. When she began to weep and protest they calledthe police who handcuffed her arms behind her back and dragged her away to aholding cell. They left her chained alone to a bench crying inconsolably. Notlong after she was found dead the chain shackling her to the bench stretchedacross her throat.Surely US Air/Mesa employees aren't bad people. They're doing their jobs --understaffed and underpaid -- in an industry with seemingly no oversight oraccountability.My husband and I didn't just get mad we got even. Upon our return to SantaBarbara we filed a complaint in small claims court for $7500 the maximumallowed. US Air settled with us in June.Carol Gotbaum's family may be getting ready to sue too. But it's too late for her.bardachreports@aol.com ",DOT-OST-2001-9325,"Air Transport Association of America, Inc. - Petition for Rulemaking",Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2001-9325-1289,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2007-10-16T00:00:00-04:00,Anonymous,Anonymous,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
551,DOT,FALSE,0,NA,2007-11-15T00:00:00-05:00,March 9 2009 Hon. Ray LaHoodSecretary of TransportationU.S. Department of Transportation1200 New Jersey Avenue S.E.CORRECTEDWashington D.C. 20590Subject:Comments of Aviation Consumer Action Project on NPRM‰ЫПEnhancing Airline Passenger Protections‰ЫќReference:14 CFR Parts 234 253 259 and 399Docket No. DOT-OST-2007-0022RIN No. 2105-AD72SUBJECT:The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) opposes the subject NPRM (Item 1) as an unlawful delegation of DOT authority and responsibility to regulate airlines in the public interest by delegating this function the airlines themselves.  As written it is an anti-consumer regulation that would take away existing common law tort rights of airline passengers for false imprisonment and negligence in situations of long confinements on the tarmac of 3-11 hours that airlines now subject approximately 300000 passengers a year to and substitute an unenforceable contract cause of action.  ACAP supports Items 2-7 of the NPRM. Dear Secretary LaHood:The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) was founded in 1971 as 501(c ) 3 nonprofit organization that acts as voice for air travelers on issues of safety security and airline consumer rights and interests.  It has held longstanding membership on the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) and the Aviation Security Advisory Committee.  We have testified before Congress on the issues in this NPRM and filed comments with DOT.  I have been executive director of ACAP since 1997 and as an attorney have represented ACAP individual consumers and Flyersrights.org (fka the Coalition for an Airline Passengers Bill of Rights) in the federal and state courts on the issues addressed in this NRPM.1.  Putting Contingency Plans in the Contract of Carriage.This NPRM (1) is a last gasp Bush Administration/Airline Industry effort to turn over DOT regulatory authority to the regulated party.  It would lead to a multiplicity of unenforceable ‰ЫПstandards‰Ыќ and ‰ЫПplans.‰Ыќ  Some airlines already are using a 4 to 6 hour guideline for tarmac confinements.  As there is presently no federal standard state common law standards for negligence and false imprisonment state criminal statutes involving unsafe operation of aircraft and wrongful imprisonment or reckless endangerment and possibly constitutional protections against unreasonable seizure are the only legal protections airline passengers have against indefinite tarmac confinements.  Most airlines now have or claim to have contingency plans to deal with flight disruptions of more than 2 hours.  But they are vague and commonly ignored (e.g. American Airlines has a contingency plan that is supposed to be activated after a 2 hours of delay but it was been found by the OIG to have been ignored and violated repeatedly in a Sept. 2007 report of its 12/29/06 mass diversion and stranding of over 100 flights involving over 10000 passengers).  Such plans are vague and there is nothing in them that a airline passenger can really enforce in a contract action.  Such plans placed in the contract of carriage would just be another way for airlines to absolve themselves of responsibility for long tarmac delays diversions and confinements.These confinements of 3- 11 hours now affect approximately 300000 passengers per year and have led to a national outcry and the formation of a national grass roots organization Flyersrights.org with over 24000 members.  The claims of the Air Transport Association that tarmac confinements have declined are false or at least unproven.  The DOT BTS only recently began collecting these statistics in 2008 and has had to remove the data presented by the airlines as ‰ЫПcorrupted‰Ыќ and therefore unreliable.The proposed regulation would wipe out existing legal protections and in our view would lead to more not less tarmac confinements as each airline would be in effect be able to write its own rule.  Such an unlawful delegation of DOT regulatory authority  would no doubt be challenged in court.   The age of self-regulation and deregulation whether in the financial industry air safety food safety or airline consumer protection is over.  It has been thoroughly discredited by scandals and disasters over the past two years and even rejected by many of its former advocates.  The Obama DOT must reject the mantra of former DOT Secretary Peters that the ‰ЫПmarket‰Ыќ will solve all consumer problems.  Senator and Candidate Obama endorsed airline passenger rights legislation that would outlaw tarmac confinements of over 3 hours which this NPRM would clearly not do.  When an airline passenger brings an action in state court  the airline almost invariably has it removed to federal court on grounds of federal preemption.  The defendant airline will then file a series of motions to have the case transferred to its home state often far from the consumer passenger‰ЫЄs residence.  The cost of such litigation far exceeds the individual claims for ordinary delays or tarmac confinements.  The airlines are generally successful in having such lawsuits dismissed discouraged or abandoned.  Indeed a review of cases under CCH Aviation cases shows that virtually the only breach of contract cases brought under the contracts of carriage successfully involve cargo shipments by commercial shippers.   You can view the many technical defenses Recent cases involving passenger strandings which include  Ray v American Airlines Inc. US DC WD AR 08-5072 Hanni v American Airlines Inc. US DC ND CA 08-732; Harper v American Airlines Inc. US DC ND AL 08-________ (filed 12/29/08); Biscone v JetBlue Airways Corp. NYS SC Queens Co. 3776/2008.  The motions to dismiss or transfer or for summary judgment filed by the airline defendants can be viewed online at Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) or the electronic dockets of the New York State Uniform Court System web site.Under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) (perhaps better described as the Consumer Class Action Elimination Act of 2005) nearly all state consumer class actions (which involves any case with a potential total claim over $5 Million) are removed to federal court where the bar is so high for certification that very few consumer class actions have ever been certified since this statute went into effect.  In the 5th Circuit which is the home of American Southwest and Continental Airlines none have been certified.  As to the issue of tarmac confinements only one 1999 case against Northwest Airlines has been certified as a class action to our knowledge and that occurred in Michigan state court involving confinements of up to 9 hours of 4000 passengers prior to the enactment of CAFA. Only through class actions in federal court or in local small claims court is it possible for airline passengers to judicially enforce breach of contract to tort claims that do not involve serious physical injury or death.  And since a class action requires that many passengers be involved with common facts and law only mass stranding events would normally qualify.Some airlines already provide for compensation for delays and associated expenses of overnight lodging in their contracts of carriage but these provisions are not as a practical matter enforceable and are frequently ignored or avoided entirely by airlines coding nearly every delayed or canceled flight as weather or FAA Air Traffic Control related.  There is no effective oversight by DOT and no fines of substance for airline violation of their own contracts or customer service plans or contingency plans or internal policies and none seems likely in the foreseeable future.The NPRM if adopted would mean domestic US airline passengers would have rights inferior to those provided to international passengers under the Montreal Convention of 1999.  Under Art. 19 passengers may recover damages for delay of up to  about $6400 on a near strict liability basis.  An airline to avoid liability has the burden of proving that it took all reasonable steps to avoid the delay or that the delay was impossible to avoid.  Damages include compensation for inconvenience as well as out of pocket losses and this treaty overrides the limitations or exclusions commonly found in domestic airline contracts of carriage which make promises in those contracts largely illusory.  Should NPRM (Item 1) be adopted in any form it should include provisions in domestic contracts of carriage a) requiring payment of litigation expenses of the passenger should s/he substantially prevail in the lawsuit b) be no less favorable to domestic passengers than international passengers c) should specifically authorize suits in state as well as federal courts d) authorize class actions where appropriate with the consumer class representative receiving a reasonable sum in compensation his time and representational responsibilities of the class payment of class notification expenses by the airline defendant plus treble damages or minimum compensation of  four times the ticket price and e) have a hard 3 hour passenger right to deplane plus delay compensation of $10 per minute for on ground confinements over 3 hours. Only with such pro-consumer provisions will airlines have an incentive to change their existing practices of ignoring passenger complaints and claims with impunity or offering only token compensation such as discount coupons or restricted vouchers.Items 2-7.  ACAP has long advocated for Truth in Scheduling regulation as a first line of defense against congestion delays caused by over scheduling by airlines.  These proposed measures are in line with our recommendations and would address the No. 1 airline passenger complaint:  flight delays.   As scheduling has been decontrolled airlines now have incentives to unrealistically schedule flights at popular times for competitive reasons which in turn leads to unnecessary congestion at major choke point airports like NYC and Chicago.  These regulations should allow consumers to avoid chronically delayed flights should eliminate deceptively scheduled flights and help relieve congestion delays at choke point airports.

They will definitely blow the failing airline companies away in fares. The only request as a consumer is that we the passengers are not treatedlike cattle as is the case of SW airlines.  I have flown with them for theirlower rates but you get what you pay for horrific customer service and boardinglike cattle.  SW over books all of their flights and as a handicapped person Ihappened to be in the bathroom while my cattle group was called ( I have abladder disease) and was told my seat was given away even though my co- ownerand a manager of my business were there they refused to accept that I was inthe bathroom and gave my seat away after being at the airport 2 hours earlychecking luggage getting a cattle boarding pass  and was treated very poorly.In fact we had to file a police report as my partner in business was physicallyassaulted by their boarding pass collectors.  He was just trying to make mycase I was only gone 3 minutes and was not allowed passage.  Instead I wasrouted through Reno and had a 4 hour delay  it was  supposed to be a non stopflight to Portland OR. in 2000. My partner in business was upset by this poortreatment and wrote on the barf bag on the way to Reno that ""SW Airlines Bites""and attached it to his shirt. In Reno they deplaned him keep in mind we shouldhave been to Portland long ago at this time and called the police who refusedto arrest him as no crime was committed.  The customer service manager put himunder citizen's arrest and the police had no choice but to take him to the Renosheriff's office.  I deplaned to go bail him out his first and only arrest(quasi as it was a citizen's arrest)  We attended a court hearing in Reno and hewas acquitted immediately as he posed no threat this was pre 9-11.  It cost usover 3000 dollars and we intended to sue and then 9-11 happened and we figuredit would be difficult in the state of high alerts to get a jury trial that mighthave seen his writing on the barf bag as a threat. what a joke.  They kickpeople off for the content of their t- shirts since that time.

Key Points Related to DBE NPRM Docket # OST‰ЫТ2012‰ЫТ0147‰ЫўPaperwork and Disclosure Burden:  The NPRM proposes significantly increasing the paperwork burden on DBEs by requiring new disclosure requirements and longer more complex forms.  While we commend the move to require universal use of standardized application and personal net worth (PNW) forms without modification the proposal to significantly increase the paperwork requirements for DBEs is unacceptable.  Our organizations have heard many reports of firms that never get certified and firms that choose to leave the DBE program because the paperwork burden is too great.  There is not sufficient evidence that those who are intent on defrauding the program will be persuaded to act honestly by imposing additional paperwork requirements on all DBEs.  Instead US DOT should aim for a net decrease in the time spent by DBEs to fill out application and PNW forms and a net decrease in the time required by Unified Certification Program (UCP) staff to review and verify the forms.  As a result of such a change UCP staff could focus on monitoring and enforcement of DBE program requirements.  To this end we urge US DOT to:oConsider which new information and documentation is most needed by UCP certifiers and those at US DOT who must review certification appeals.  Ensure that other paperwork requirements or disclosures are reduced or eliminated to result in an application process (and annual no change affidavit process) that represents a net decrease in time spent on paperwork by both DBEs and recipient certification staff.    Spousal PNW forms or annual PNW forms should not be required.  There are other far less burdensome ways to collect this information.oRelease the methodology used as the foundation for the paperwork time estimates included in the NPRM and all methodologies used to calculate paperwork time estimates for any final rule.  oImplement the suggestion of Robert C.

Additional paperwork requests should be targeted toward those firms that are suspected of seeking to defraud the program at the time a problem is detected not imposed on the vast majority of DBEs who are honestly seeking to comply with all program requirements. It is extremely costly for legitimate minority business to  appeal deals because he/she hires professional license holder to handle tasks he/she can not due to a lack of license. In addition the government should release the methodology used as the foundation for the paperwork time estimates included in the NPRM and all methodologies used to calculate paperwork time estimates for any final rule.  With respect to good faith efforts in addition to asking firms to identify DBEs they intend to use verification of payment to those DBE's should be required before final payment is released.

I will present this in two phases first why the decision should be reversed and secondly what caused Miles City to be considered for termination.1. Miles City has only one reliable commerical transportation into and out of the city. Our present commerical bus has been suspended by DOT.  If we were to lose EAS that would mean no reliable tranmsportation.2. There are many Disabled Veterans who need hospital care in Denver or SLC.  If we lose EAS they have no transportation for these well deserving veterans same goes for the elderly .3. 7 months out of the year we have the possibility of winter conditions which makes it a saety hazard driving to Billings4. Loss of EAS would dampen our econmic development in the future with coal and oil just starting to expand.Wht caused the problem for Miles City1. We have 3 outgoing flights two to Billings and one to Glendive.  The one to Glendive no one would ever ride. If this was not considered as outgoing we might make the requirement.2. there are no compatible flights out of Miles City to connect with other carriers resulting in less people to fly as they would have to stay overnight in one of the connecting hubs which increases the cost.3. If the numbers were looked at in 2011 we had approximately 1094 outgoing passengers The first year this other carrier took over we droped to slightly over 324 riders.  What casued this we all are intelligent enough to look at the numbers outgoing flight times and connecting flight times to determine why Miles City numbers have dropped.4. The decision should not be based on one year by a different carrier but based on years past performance with all carriers involvedI strongly request that Miles City be given a chance to show with compatible flights good connection times at the correct hub we would be successfulYou must do whats right for Montana our area is to large to compare with any other areas.,DOT-OST-1997-2605,"Essential Air Service at Glasgow, Glendive, Havre, Lewistown, Miles City, Sidney, and Wolf Point, Montana",Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-1997-2605-0192,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2013-04-22T00:00:00-04:00,David Wheeler,David Wheeler,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Given the track record of this carrier in the markets its entered since 2014 and the shoddy treatment meted out to its many passengers we urge the US Department of Transportation to continue to deny this application. Dynamic Airways has left Guyanese New Yorkers and returning Guyanese in the lurch at J.F. K. International Airport in New York since 2014. The latest incident occurred on July 31 2016 when dozens of Guyanese with pre-paid tickets and confirmation to travel were brazenly told the flight was cancelled after showing up at the J.F.K. airport in New York City to check in. Reports reaching ICN indicate that many of the passengers were members of the Guyanese Diaspora in New York City and had shelled out hard earned money to book travel months in advance to coincide with their vacations as Dynamic promoted specials to their country of birth. The passengers were turned away without much explanation and then told they could not be accommodated with new bookings for weeks. This is a pattern of abuse. Just take a look at the complaints filed with the North Carolina Business Bureau. Additionally this carrier without much warning just canned their Fort Lauderdale -Caracas route leaving passengers booked to return after Aug. 13 2016 in the lurch. This carrier should never be considered and infact should be investigated for its shoddy service and business practices. We hope the US DOT will take our comment into serious consideration in any appeals launched by this carrier. ,DOT-OST-2016-0021,2016 U.S.-Cuba Frequency Allocation Proceedings,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2016-0021-0972,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2016-08-04T00:00:00-04:00,Felicia Persaud,Comment from Felicia Persaud,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With a spirit and history of entrepreneurship and trade Cork has developed into a thriving hub of global growth sectors in ICT pharmaceuticals healthcare biotechnology food and business services. In all we have 137 multinational companies based in Cork. They are attracted by the talented people the value for money the quality of life and the successful businesses already operating here. Significant opportunity exists through continuing this approach of supporting existing US based companies to grow and those who will decide that their future is in Cork and this proposed direct transatlantic route to Cork Airport will be of significant benefit to the fortunes of both US and Irish based business opportunities.Specifically with regard to tourism development Cork is uniquely positioned within the country as the natural international gateway point for visitors to the South West and South East of Ireland. This coupled with our array of tourism assets our business tourism strength and our location at the start and finish of the both of the key national tourism experience brands the Wild Atlantic Way and Irelands Ancient East makes Cork a location of international appeal. Already Cork attracts 17-18% of total visitors to Ireland. Ambitious investment and growth plans are being progressed which are presenting Cork as the premier destination for US visitors to enable them to maximise their visit to our shores. This proposed transatlantic route direct to Cork presents the opportunity for US citizens particularly those from the east coast to have direct access to the most unique and compelling location in Ireland from which to explore and be immersed in the culture of these incredible tourism experiences. And of course the significance of the opportunity for the Irish Diaspora in the US which is particularly strong along the east coast and Massachusetts and Boston in particular cannot be forgotten. This proposed direct route to Cork is a major opportunity to support those who continue to have significant family cultural and heritage ties to our region. I therefore strongly support the granting of the foreign carrier permit to Norwegian Air International Ltd as the benefits to citizens and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic are considerable.CERTIFICATE OF SERVICEThe undersigned certifies that on 11th May 2016  a true and correct copy of the foregoing Comment of the Chief Executive of Cork County Council Ireland -Strong supporter of Open Skies and the potential opportunity to grow tourism and business links between Ireland and the US through the granting of this foreign carrier permit to Norwegian Air International Ltd. was served by electronic mail on the individuals identified below:dan.weiss@united.com chris.walker@delta.commlbenge@zsrlaw.comrpommer@atlasair.comrussell.bailey@alpa.orgjonathan.cohen@alpa.orgedw@ttd.orgclytle@portoakland.comkgeorge@broward.orgmrichardson@swapa.orgrobert.wirick@aa.comfrancis.heil@aa.comhoward.kass@aa.cominfo@airlineinfo.com jesse.elliot@faa.govnicholas.tsokris@faa.govjohn.chen@faa.govjohn.allen@faa.govanita.mosner@hklaw.comjennifer.nowak@hklaw.comnssparks@fedex.comgbleopard@fedex.comdberg@airlines.orgjcasey@airlines.orgkglatz@airlines.orgcc@eurocockpit.beejames@jamhoff.comEngleTS@state.govsshur@traveltech.orgeugene.alford@trade.govDavid.Batchelor@sesarju.euOttar.Ostnes@sd.dep.no John.Hanlon@ELFAA.com Robert.Finamore@dot.govBrian.Hedberg@dot.govCharles.Leocha@travelersunited.orgkeith@washingtonairports.com pruden@asta.org rdow@ustravel.orgTim Lucey Chief Executive Cork County Council.,DOT-OST-2013-0204,Norwegian Air International Limited - Foreign Permit/Exemption - U.S.-EU Open Skies,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2013-0204-10819,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2016-05-11T00:00:00-04:00,Tim Lucey,Comment from Tim Lucey,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Given the huge concentration of multinational technology firms in Cork (Apple Amazon Dell Etc OpenText Oracle) this could only serve to benefit continued intercontinental growth of tech industry to the benefit of all.For general public the appeal of traveling from the second largest city in Ireland to two major East coast cities will have untold tourism benefits which would also be reciprocated for the massive Irish-decendant populations in NY and Boston. And from a personal perspective as someone living in Cork my closest friend has just recently been married to a US citizen and they are expecting their first child. They will be living primarily in NY but splitting their time to Boston the wife's hometown. The addition of these routes would be immensely valuable in allowing me to continue to share in their life without the absurd 3+ bus travel needed to get to an Irish Airport with US routes. ,DOT-OST-2013-0204,Norwegian Air International Limited - Foreign Permit/Exemption - U.S.-EU Open Skies,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2013-0204-10327,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2016-05-10T00:00:00-04:00,Colm Pattwell,Comment from Colm Pattwell,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We are talking about a country that permits 6 months of paid maternity leave along with a very generous amount of days annual leave per year.I am from Ireland and work in the U.S. and this is most definitely not the case in this country. To all the people opposing - YOU HAVENT GOT A CLUE WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.You are ignorantly opposing on the basis that you are uneducated to the fact that this airline will be headquartered in the Republic of Ireland and we have impeccable employee protection and employee rights laws and probably in most if not all cases - better than the United States of America.

591,DOT,FALSE,0,NA,2016-04-15T00:00:00-04:00,I was pleased to learn that DOT recently proposed to approve Norwegian's subsidiary Norwegian Air International's (NAI) application for authority to fly to the United States. As a frequent traveler I strongly encourage the DOT to act quickly and issue final approval of NAI's foreign air carrier permit. Like most consumers I value choice when traveling and we can certainly all benefit from lower fares between the U.S. and Europe.Approval of NAI's service is a win-win scenario for many reasons:First as a low-cost carrier entering the U.S.-Europe market NAI will help make fares more affordable and incentivize all carriers to improve their service and offerings - an often overlooked but crucial need for all travelers today. Norwegian has been offering affordable high-quality service in Europe for decades. This is a huge benefit for consumers.Second NAI will offer affordable fares between the U.S. and Europe which will make traveling internationally a possibility for so many more hard-working Americans. Affordable service will open the leisure market and encourage tourism on both sides of the Atlantic; not only can Americans travel abroad more affordably but more international tourists can also reach our shores leading to massive economic benefit in the tourism and hospitality industries.Third NAI will serve U.S. airports and communities that often are overlooked by other carriers further increasing opportunities for international travel across the U.S. and Europe. For example NAI has is committed to serving Las Vegas Oakland Fort Lauderdale and Orlando and will launch a new route between Boston and Cork Ireland - never before served by a U.S. airline.Fourth Norwegian will create tens of thousands of jobs in the aviation travel and hospitality sectors - all of which benefit the U.S. economy.In conclusion I strongly support NAI's proposal to serve the U.S. market and encourage the federal government to quickly grant final approval of its operating certificate. By doing so consumers like me can begin taking advantage of the affordable high-quality service that NAI will offer and our entire country can continue to reap the benefits of economic growth.

NAI is headquartered in Dublin and Norwegian will be subject to Irish labour laws which are amongst the strongest in world. Ireland equally has one of the highest ranked civil aviation authorities in the world and an excellent safety record.In summary the establishment of these flight paths are an excellent opportunity to strengthen pre-existing ties and create new economic opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic.As the owner of a Restaurant and B&B in the Mizen Peninsula I am sure this new arrangement will increase tourism in our area and enable the residents of the Mizen peninsula to visit the USA regularly. ,DOT-OST-2013-0204,Norwegian Air International Limited - Foreign Permit/Exemption - U.S.-EU Open Skies,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2013-0204-12108,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2016-05-16T00:00:00-04:00,Sue Hill,Comment from Sue Hill,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I am an American citizen currently living in Europe attending graduate school. Transatlantic travel as become very noncompetitive. Routes across the Atlantic have collapsed into a non-competitive scenario with only three airline groups controlling over 80% of all seats and flights.  Norwegian Air will help restore some of the needed balance by encouraging competition. Norwegian Air will surely employ a mix of Americans and other nationalities on its planes diluting the net effect of any jobs that theoretically might be at risk by their presence and future growth.  Additional employment caused by extra jobs created by Norwegian at airports and in tourist operators at the American destinations are likely to massively more than offset the few jobs possibly lost.I urge you to turn back the endless appeals and allow Norwegian Air to proceed. ,DOT-OST-2013-0204,Norwegian Air International Limited - Foreign Permit/Exemption - U.S.-EU Open Skies,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2013-0204-7671,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2016-05-06T00:00:00-04:00,Randall Newton,Comment from Randall Newton,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

And other times the airline is seen as being heavy handed or worse when dealing with passengers.  Without video will be fewer cases being settled out of court and I predict more cases that end up in court.

The regulations perpetuate the following outstanding problems: the proposed rules still do not require accessible restrooms on enough aircraft still don't provide enough leg room for people with service animals; still discriminate against deaf travelers. If you need more room than provided by current seating you must pay extra. The proposed rules would continue as well to exempt airports themselves from the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements; things that fall under the Air Carrier Access Act have fewer requirements than those under the ADA.  Others include inaccessible websites -- people thus prevented from buying cheaper online tickets are penalized.Respectfully Connie J. ArnoldP.S.

Pena as well as failing to meet DOT standards for the DBE Program.  To substantiate my reasoning I submit the following information from the DOT OSDBU website specifically from web address: http://osdbu.dot.gov/DBEProgram/sectionbysection.cfm:‰ЫПQ. Section 26.45 How Do Recipients Set Overall Goals? A.Since its inception the recipient's overall goal has been the heart of the DBE program. Responding to Adarand DOT clarified the theory and purpose of the overall goal in the SNPRM. In the proposed rule the Department made clear that the purpose of the overall goal-- and in fact the DBE program as a whole--is to achieve a ``level playing field'' for DBEs seeking to participate in federal-aid transportation contracting. To reach a level playing field recipients need to examine their programs and their markets and determine the amount of participation they would expect DBEs to achieve in the absence of discrimination and the effects of past discrimination. The focus of the goal section of the SNPRM was to propose ways to measure what a level playing field would look like and to seek input on the availability of data to make such a measurement.‰ЫќUnder ‰ЫПThe Proposed Rules and Comments‰Ыќ please refer to paragraph 8:‰ЫПIn view of the complexity and importance of the goal setting process and the many issues raised by commenters the Department has decided to adopt a two step process for goal setting. The process is intended to provide the maximum flexibility for recipients while ensuring that goals are based on the availability of ready willing and able DBEs in each recipient's relevant market. The Department believes that this approach is critical to meeting our constitutional obligation to ensure that the program is narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of discrimination. The first step of the process will be to create a baseline figure for the relative availability of ready willing and able DBEs in each recipient's market. The second step will be to make adjustments from the base figure relying on an examination of additional evidence past experience local expertise and anticipated changes in DOT-assisted contracting over the coming year.‰ЫќUnder ‰ЫПStep 1: Determining a Base Figure for the Overall Goal ‰ЫП please refer to paragraphs 1 2 3 & 15:Paragraph 1: ‰ЫПThe base figure is intended to be a measurement of the current percentage of ready willing and able businesses that are DBEs. Ensuring that this figure is based on demonstrable evidence of each recipient's relevant market conditions will help to ensure that the program remains narrowly tailored. To be explicit recipients cannot simply use the 10 percent national goal their goal from the previous year or their DBE participation level from the previous year as their base figure. Instead all recipients must take an actual measurement of their marketplace using the best evidence they have available and derive a base figure that is as fair and accurate a representation as possible of the percentage of available businesses that are DBEs.‰ЫќParagraph 2: ‰ЫП‰Ы_In this final rule the Department is placing primary emphasis on the principles underlying the measurement mandating only that a measurement of the relative availability of DBEs be made on the basis of demonstrable evidence of relevant market conditions rather than requiring that any particular procedure or formula be used‰Ы_‰ЫќParagraph 3: ‰Ыќ‰Ы_ By fixing only the basic principle but allowing the methodology to change recipients will have the opportunity to fine tune the process each year as their experience grows and the data available to them improve. Finally the rule makes sure that every recipient will have at least one reasonable and practical goal setting method available to them.‰ЫќParagraph 15: ‰Ыќ‰Ы_ the methodology must be based on demonstrable data of relevant market conditions and be designed to reach a goal that the recipient would expect DBEs to achieve in the absence of discrimination.‰ЫќUnder ‰ЫПAdditional Goal Setting Issues‰Ыќ please refer to paragraph 1:Paragraph 1: ‰ЫПThe Department proposed in both the 1992 NPRM and the 1997 SNPRM that overall goals be calculated as a percentage of DOT funds a recipient expects to expend in DOT-assisted contracts‰Ы_‰ЫќBy going to an every three-year overall goal submission for Part 26 recipients we would be failing to achieve the originally stated two objectives and the published directives.  AIP (Airport Improvement Program) projects vary significantly from year to year in regard to construction work items as well as dollars available for projects.  For example one year you might be determining the DBE goal for a $1.0 million asphalt overlay project and the next year a $2.1 million lighting project.  NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) codes for these two projects vary greatly and significantly affect goal determination.  For clarification NAICS codes are used to determine the work items for the AIP project and from this list we derive the DBEs potentially available to perform the work.As referenced in ‰ЫПTips for Goal-Setting in the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program‰Ыќ located on FAA Office of Civil Rights website as well as the DOT OSDBU website: ‰ЫПSTEP ONE:  The most important thing to remember about step one of the goal setting process is that you are attempting to come up with a measurement of the actual relative availability of DBEs to perform the types of contracts (both prime and sub) that you intend to let.‰Ыќ  The types of projects and the availability of ready willing and able DBEs will most definitely vary from year to year.  Therefore an every three-year goal submission does not ‰ЫПlevel the playing field‰Ыќ and does not ensure a ‰ЫПnarrowly tailored‰Ыќ program.Regarding ‰ЫПwhether to provide for annual reviews of goals or adjustments for new opportunities‰Ыќ for AIP projects that change from year to year this is a must.  An annual review ultimately defeats the purpose of the every three-year goal submission because a review requires proceeding through the entire goal-setting process and results in the new submittal of an overall goal.  In a nutshell the same amount of work is required for an annual review or an overall goal submission in order to ‰ЫПlevel the playing field‰Ыќ and to ‰ЫПnarrowly tailor‰Ыќ the program.  An annual review ultimately is a NEW OVERALL GOAL SUBMISSION.The every three-year goal submission probably works well for ACDBE 49 CFR Part 23 where NAICS codes are generally the same from year to year.  However for 49 CFR Part 26 where the NAICS codes change significantly from year to year the every three-year goal submission would not work well and ultimately defeats the purpose of the two main objectives of the DBE Program as well as the directives issued on the OSDBU website.,DOT-OST-2009-0081,Disadvantaged Business Enterprise; Overall Goal Schedule and Substitution,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2009-0081-0005,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2009-05-19T00:00:00-04:00,Anita Dougherty,Anita Dougherty ,2105-AD76,Attachment Contents : ...failing to achieve these two objectives which are based on the Supreme <endeca_term>Court</endeca_term> decision regarding Adarand Constructors v.

After reviewing the Notice of proposed rulemaking (‰ЫПNPRM‰Ыќ) the Ohio Department of Transportation (‰ЫПODOT‰Ыќ) would like to offer the following comments:Burden of Proof for Application DenialsOn page 25819 of the NPRM there is discussion regarding creation of a proposed rebuttable presumption reciprocity system where a firm that is either home-state certified in another state or is 8(a) certified with the SBA and seeks certification with another state UCP.   USDOT (""the Department"") is proposing to create a rebuttable presumption that the firm should be certified based on either another home state certification or SBA 8(a) certification.  USDOT has asked for comment regarding whether the prospective firm or the certifying agency should bear the burden of proof in the newly proposed proceeding.In order to remain consistent with the current standard that an applicant bears the burden of proof during an appeal of denied application ODOT believes that the applicant should continue to bear this burden regardless of its status of holding another state certification or a SBA 8(a) certification.  Schedule for On-Site Reviews  The Department is seeking comments on how often on-site reviews should be conducted.  The NPRM suggests every three to five years initially but later seems to indicate five years is too long to go between on-sites.  The Ohio UCP currently aims to conduct on-site reviews every three years and believe this is an effective schedule for reviews.  Accordingly we would like to see the regulations require reviews no more frequently than every three years.  We agree that on-sites at five year intervals would be too infrequent.Fostering Small Business ParticipationThe proposed rules include a requirement that recipients create a small business element in their DBE programs.  In early 2010 ODOT attempted to add a small business element to a large ARRA funded project.  This proved to be a very difficult task to do as the regulations are currently written.  Ultimately ODOT removed this small business initiative.  However we support the concept of fostering small business participation if adequate resources are made available to the state DOTs for such a program.Counting49 CFR 26.55 (a)(1) states that supplies and equipment purchased by a subcontractor from a prime contractor will not be counted towards DBE participation.  In 2007 ODOT requested a waiver from the requirement in 49 CFR 26.55(a)(1).  This request was prompted by the unique market conditions in Ohio where ownership of asphalt companies has been condensed to a few select companies.  Additionally the ODOT Construction and Material Specifications prohibit the hauling of hot mix from a distance greater than 50 miles.  These two things combined have created a situation that makes it difficult for DBE firms to succeed in the competitive bid environment.  However ODOT‰ЫЄs request for waiver from the rule was denied.  In 2009 ODOT submitted comments again supporting a change of the rule to allow items obtained by DBEs for a contract to be counted for DBE credit regardless of their non-DBE source (i.e. regardless of whether it was purchased from the prime).  Although it seems clear that the Department is not planning to change this portion of the regulations believing that the basic policy objective of the current regulation is a sound one ODOT would like to offer one additional comment.  ODOT understands that the concern in this area is that the DBE program is structured to ensure that the DBE subcontractor is performing a commercially useful function.  ODOT does not want to see a ""pass through"" system created.  However ODOT suggests that there could be a solution responsive to the needs of Ohio contractors as well as the concerns of the Department.   In the area of materials and supplies 49 CFR 26.55 (a)(1) could be amended to permit supplies and/or materials purchased by a DBE subcontractor from a prime contractor to be counted towards DBE participation so long as the DBE subcontractor is responsible for installing any materials purchased from the prime contractor on that project.  ODOT believes this would ensure that the DBE firm is in fact performing a commercially useful function.

GeneralFrom a legal point of view and speaking generally we are fundamentally concerned about the NPRM.  It does not seem to be technically fully mature.  It appears that the international dimension of the originally intended purpose to enhance passenger rights within the US was not sufficiently assessed beforehand and therefore not sufficiently addressed in the proposal.  In particular the proposal does not always adequately describe the envisaged geographical scope of application.  However this leads to uncertainty in an international business such as aviation ‰ЫТ this is in particular a lesson learnt from the EU Commission‰ЫЄs consumer protection endeavours in Europe concerning Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004.It should be clear from the outset that exterritorial application of the NPRM would conflict and interfere with international and EU law as well as the national laws of any EU Member State which we deem not acceptable.  The NPRM therefore should only be interpreted in a way that it does not have exterritorial effects. Furthermore it should be noted that EU carriers such as Air Berlin are already subject to stringent EU passenger rights regulations and therefore the proposal does not only create new (additional) burdens to operate routes to/ from the US but it also contains conflicts with EU law and thereby creates a risk for confusion and legal uncertainty.The NPRM is subject to international law.  The three most important and fundamental legal texts in the area of aviation in this context are the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage (Montreal Convention) and the EU-US Air Transport Agreement.  The NPRM may take effect only within the scope and limitations set out in these regulations.

During my remarks at that meeting I made reference to a report being prepared for OCTA by Ms. Susan Binder and the firm of Cambridge Systematics.  This report compiles information from over forty interviews with highway and transit project implementers as well as several national trade associations which represent these entities.  As I said at the public meeting this report contains the details regarding  proposals which OCTA believes will greatly assist in expediting project delivery. Although the report is still being finalized the Draft Final Report is complete and was reviewed by our Board on March 28 2011 with unanimous positive reaction. Therefore in order to meet the comment deadline for this docket I am submitting the Draft Final Report for your consideration.  Appendix D to the report provides a table of the recommended changes to expedite project delivery noting where regulatory changes may be needed. OCTA expects that the report will be finalized within the next few days at which time we will make a copy of the Final Report available to DOT separately and as a further submission to this docket if it remains open for comments.SincerelyDarrell JohnsonDeputy Chief Executive OfficerOrange County Transportation Authority,DOT-OST-2011-0025,Notice of Regulatory Review of Existing DOT Regulations,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2011-0025-0043,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Orange County Transportation Authority,2011-04-01T00:00:00-04:00,Darrell Johnson,Orange County Transportation Authority,NA,NA,"Attachment Contents : ...Federal agencies are looking for ‰ЫПbullet-proof‰Ыќ documents to minimize risk of <endeca_term>lawsuits</endeca_term>.

The analysis should include a review of what went into the estimates as well as how accurately they reflect the real world costs associated with implementation. For instance did the cost estimates for the regulation include both the cost of implementation as well as on-going costs?  What federal funds were provided for state and local implementation?  Did they cover the costs?  Were there under-funded or unfunded mandates?   Could the regulation be modified to minimize the fiscal impact on state and local governments?NCSL also recommends that the department review the level of consultation that occurred in the development of any significant regulation. Consultation with state and local governments should be conducted early in the process prior to a document being sent to the Office of Management and Budget. As part of the department‰ЫЄs plan to review existing significant rules NCSL encourages the department to reach out to organizations like NCSL to determine if meaningful consultation occurred during the development phase.The attached rail routing rule (Hazardous Materials: Enhancing Transportation Safety for Hazardous Materials Shipments--PHMSA-RSPA-2004-18730; RIN 2137-AE02) is an example of where ‰ЫПmeaningful‰Ыќ consultation was not conducted.NCSL looks forward to working with the department as this process moves forward.(See attached file.),DOT-OST-2011-0025,Notice of Regulatory Review of Existing DOT Regulations,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2011-0025-0088,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,National Conference of State Legislatures,2011-04-05T00:00:00-04:00,Helen Narvasa,National Conference of State Legislatures,NA,Attachment Contents : ...PHMSA‰ЫТRSPA‰ЫТ2004‰ЫТ18730 p. 2 transport of hazardous materials should a <endeca_term>court</endeca_term> of competent jurisdiction make that determination.

A review of published data titled ""Electronic cigarettes:  Human health effects"" written by Dr. Priscilla Callahan-Lyon Office of Science Center for Tobacco Products Food and Drug Administration lists 48 references in regard to research on how e-cigarettes affect users and those nearby.  The review informs the public ""Nicotine is readily absorbed through the airway skin mucous membranes and gastrointestinal tract.  Acute exposure to inhaled nicotine may cause dizziness nausea or vomiting.""ANSR is receiving complaints that confirm that non-smokers who suffer from respiratory and cardiovascular impairments are reacting to exposure to e-cigarette vapor.  Immediate reactions include wheezing difficulty breathing oxygen deprivation and reduced levels of consciousness.

Infants young children the elderly and disabled passengers are especially vulnerable to exposure to e-cigarette vapor (ECV).  The risk of fire must be eliminated. The Department of Transportation must support the action taken voluntarily by the airlines by taking action to prohibit the use of e-cigarettes on all air carriers and in all airport facilities without exception and without delay.

Federal Court Approved Adaexpert Witness.  Miami Beach Florida 305-864-7070 Adaexpert@Gmail.com( 1 )     The issue for we service dog owners in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making is the question posed by the DOT on where to locate service animal relief areas.  The DOT is seeking input on whether service animal relief areas should be located inside or outside ‰ЫПthe sterile area.‰Ыќ   The sterile area is understood to be the secure area between the TSA screening checkpoints and the gate area where passengers board or deplane the aircraft.                     We service dog owners thank DOT for this proposal seeking input for relief areas located outside the sterile area that in essence creates barriers for disabled passengers. Service dog owners urge DOT to require a minimum of one service animal relief area per terminal located INSIDE the sterile area to significantly reduce the time and distance for disabled passengers whose assistance dogs need to use the service animal relief areas.  Many times gates are over a quarter mile apart. We implore the DOT to require a centrally located relief area INSIDE the sterile area. If not possible the airport could build two service animal relief areas inside the sterile area one at either end of the terminal to ensure time and distance do not pose barriers for disabled passengers traveling with canine assistants.  These relief areas need to be located outdoors to the extent feasible on the sterile side of the airport something the TSA discussed in its Guidelines issued in May 2011.        Owners believe service animal relief areas located inside the sterile area best serve the needs of the majority of disabled passengers with assistance dogs when on the way to the gate changing planes or during a stopover and immediately after arriving at their destination before passengers have to collect ,DOT-OST-2011-0182,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance (U.S. Airports),Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2011-0182-0223,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Brennan Consulting Inc.,2011-11-28T00:00:00-05:00,NA,Brennan Consulting Inc.,2105-AD91,"Attachment Contents : ...11/23/2011 Submitted by, Michael Brennan, President, Brennan Consulting Inc., Federal <endeca_term>Court</endeca_term> Approved Adaexpert Witness.

CEI is a nonprofit nonpartisan public interest organization that focuses on regulatory policy from a market-oriented perspective. In our view this latest action by the Department of Transportation (Department) is part of a broader attempt to expand its unfair and deceptive practices (UDP) authority under 49 U.S.C.  41712 in a manner contrary to Congress intent in passing the Airline Deregulation Act. Bolstering this contention is the Departments admission that the projected costs of the revised rules governing airline ancillary fees greatly outweigh its projected benefits.In addition we believe the Departments proposed regulation of ancillary fees reflects a status quo bias that will adversely affect airline competition and consumer welfare.(Full comments are attached.),DOT-OST-2014-0056,Transparency of Airline Ancillary Fees and Other Consumer Protection Issues,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2014-0056-0691,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,Competitive Enterprise Institute,2014-09-25T00:00:00-04:00,NA,Competitive Enterprise Institute,2105-AE31,Attachment Contents : ...deregulatory man-date Congress expressed in the Airline Deregulation Act.10 The <endeca_term>courts</endeca_term> have so far up-held this upsetting power grab.

Many Americans like myself have had loved ones and family members die on the roadways due to unsafe conditions caused by drug misuse. The DOT rule presently before us is a welcome step forward in transportation safety. Americans individually and corporately enjoy good quality of life when the safety of our roadways and interstate commerce channels is enhanced.First the DOT's proposed rule substituting dual-specimen collection for DNA testing of urine samples is reasonable and would likely withstand legal challenge. A basic aspect of the right to privacy is control by individuals over information about themselves. The Supreme Court has allowed ""special needs"" searches such as random drug tests of railroad employees where the government needs to regulate the conduct of employees for safety purposes. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn. 489 U.S. 602. 619 (1989).Next an amendment to the DOT's drug testing protocol is appropriate and long overdue. The current rules have not been upgraded since 1990. Current research shows that what is apparent to most Americans is true: there is a sizable uptick in prescription opioid abuse in America. According to the CDC the number of opioid-involved deaths and overdose deaths is increasing. In fact they report that six out of 10 drug overdoses are now from opioids.  As more and more trucks and cars share our already-clogged highways system there are safety concerns which need to be addressed. The ability to traverse our highway system safety is integral to our economy and to our American way of life. These sometimes competing interests can both be fostered but only if adequate safeguards are in place. Annually trucks deliver approximately 70 percent of all freight composed of $671 billion in goods within the U.S. and another $590.6 in retail goods between the U.S. and our neighbors Canada and Mexico. Current estimates show that there are at least 15.5 million trucks and 3.5 million truck drivers that use America's national highway system. Of these trucks approximately one in nine are independent owner operators of Class 8 semi-trucks with a gross vehicle weight of over 33000 pounds  In 2015 Americans logged over three million vehicle miles of travel and more than 2.4 million people were injured in vehicle crashes. With increasing highway fatalities despite record high (87%) seat belt use it is clear something else is amiss. The American roadways are only as safe as its drivers. Opioid abuse by drivers is greatly decreasing roadway safety.  The DOT's proposal to add the four Class II opioids to its drug testing panel is reasonable and appropriate given that the use of opioids are increasingly abused and indicated in traffic injuries and fatalities. Drug testing can only work if it is kept current with modern drug usage trends.  The 1990 DOT drug testing procedures initially decreased traffic accidents; however recently traffic accidents and fatalities are on the rise. Drugged drivers were indicated in 11.4 percent of all fatal motor vehicle crashes in 2010 and that prescription drugs accounted for 46.5 percent of the drugs used in fatal crashes with a great increase occurring since the mid-2000s. Given the initial success of the DOT's drug screening program in reducing drugged driving traffic accidents by 10 percent and the recent 7.7 percent increase in automobile fatalities which appeared coincident with the ""opioid epidemic"" the time is ripe for the DOT to amend its drug-testing mechanism to attempt to deal with these realities. Through promulgation of this sound and timely rule the DOT is reasonably and adequately fulfilling its congressional safety mandate. Adding these four Schedule II opioid narcotics to drug testing panel does not add a new layer of DOT regulation. Rather the rule merely brings current DOT's safety screening methods. The 2017 HHS Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs using Urine requires testing for these opioids. This rule also comports with the goals of the NHTSA FHA FMCSA coalition's 2016 ""Road to Zero"" partnership. This rule will not likely result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities since the cost of additional opioid tests will be largely offset by the labs no longer having to store and categorize employees' blind samples. Plus since the labs used already routinely test other federal workers for these four opioids the additional burden is  minimal. Also since the cost of implementing this rule is below the $100 million threshold and will likely save many American lives the benefits of implementing this rule substantially outweigh program costs. In sum this DOT's proposed rule is a timely and well-reasoned upgrade to a safety rule which has lost its effectiveness over time.See attached file(s).",DOT-OST-2016-0189,Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs: Synthetic Opiates and Minor Amendments,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2016-0189-0034,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2017-03-10T00:00:00-05:00,Lori Carson,Comment from Lori Carson,2105-AE58,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The City's requested to Mid America Regional Council to use $62000 of the remaining amount allocated to the project for construction administration. The Mid America Regional Council approved the request but MoDOT denied the request citing that FHWA Missouri would not approve of the ConstructionAdministration funding after the project was bid.The construction cost estimates for the project that were prepared by a well regarding consultant engineering firm using historic bid prices was higher than the low bid for the project.  We were not able to predict that the project would bid lower than the engineers estimate.  The City's made the request in writing to MoDOT/FHWA.  MoDOT/FHWA did not provide a written response to the request but verbally indicated the request was denied.MoDOT/FHWA provided no justification for the denial of the use of federal STP funds toward construction administration even after the MPO approved the request.  MoDOT/FHWA gave no reason as towhy the request was denied and the City's can find no reason why it was denied under Title 23.  The practice of FHWA/MoDOT is to deny the obligation request to use federal funds for construction administration unless it is requested at the time of construction obligation.  Therefore Public Agencies have to enterinto contracts with Consultants prior to the project bidding.  This makes no sense.  If the bids are unreasonably high (greater than 10% of the engineers estimate) the Public Agency may have to reject the bids and potentiallycancel the project.  It is a waste of time for the consultants and Public Agency.  ,DOT-OST-2017-0057,"Review of Policy, Guidance, and Regulations Affecting Transportation Infrastructure Projects",Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0057-0029,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2017-06-21T00:00:00-04:00,Jaclyn White,Comment from Jaclyn White,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Attachment Contents : ...give such approval, then we request that you advise us of the <endeca_term>appeal</endeca_term> process we must follow, to gain approval either from FHWA Region or...",NA,NA

There has to be flexibility in the HOS with the ability to start and stop the clock instead of a ""do it all in this amount time"" mentality. The HOS takes in to account very few variables drivers face while transporting the goods the nation depends on such as traffic slow downs waiting times at shippers and receivers waiting to fuel etc.  The ELD has a tracking device component. And under the Supreme Court case US vs Jones (2012) a tracking device on a vehicle to monitor a vehicle's movement constitutes a search under the Forth Amendment. Just because the trucking industry is unfortunately so regulated does not mean that that owner operators and drivers should have their constitutional rights violated. Bottom line is the ELD should not be a one size fits all. If a member of the ATA wants an ELD in their truck(s) than so be it. If a owner operator doesn't then he/she should not be required to do so period. In my option the HOS needs to be revamped with the ability to stop and start the clock.

1051,DOT,FALSE,1,2017-12-01T23:59:59-05:00,2017-10-02T00:00:00-04:00,"I am commenting in reference to the pending ELD mandate. I feel that forcing this mandate upon everyone is going to be a major burden on the industry.  The cost alone for smaller truck companies and independent owner operators to comply is a pretty big burden in itself.  Many of these carrier have done nothing wrong and have clean safety records. I believe that criminals are granted a trial before 24/7 electronic monitoring is granted as an option to jail time. Why are trucking companies or independent operators being forced to be monitored 24/7 when they've done nothing wrong?  I also believe that it has been ruled that sex offenders aren't even allowed to be monitored 24/7. As can be seen in attached pages. So essentially this mandate is treating us as tho we are worse than criminals.  I certainly can understand eld devices being used voluntarily if operators would like to use them. Also I would understand them being forced upon carriers who continuously violate the laws.  The idea that ELD's are going to make the roads safer and save lives has also no been proven. In fact accidents have gone up the past few years.  Some of the highest accident rates are found in the very carriers who are already using Eld's. If safety was really of concern you would remove companies ability to self insure their units.  A perfect example of this is Swift.  Other issues that are going to be exposed with an ELD mandate is the lack of parking.  First and foremost at shippers and receivers.  Many of them simply do no allow trucks to come in early or stay after being loaded or unloaded. This creates issues with the mandatory 10 hour break.  While many will argue this is an HOS issue.  I feel that shippers are receivers need to be held to a higher standard Federally.  Some are now imposing fines for missing appointment times or simply tell drivers ""we will get to you when we can"".  How are we supposed to plan for that? Further delaying our work week and our next load. Mind you. Unless we are loaded and moving we are not making money.  I do believe the HOS is an issue that should be adjusted.  With more flexibility in that the ELD would be easier to adapt to.  Also pertaining to ELD's I don't understand what is wrong with the paper system. Monetarily it costs next to nothing for us to comply with paper.  There is also no security risks involved with the paper system. Security becomes an issue with ELD devices tied into the ECM's of the trucks we are operating.  The systems my employer are using uses bluetooth technology. Which is even easier to hack.  While I'm not the best at putting my thoughts into words I've done my best here to summarize them.  The ELD mandate is going to add more stress to a job that I thoroughly enjoy up until the worry about this mandate.  I have started to question whether I will be able to continue doing this job that I enjoy and was expecting to retire from.  The added stress this device is going to put on me with racing a 14 hour clock while safely operating a commercial vehicles in the Northeast corridor is not safe for me or those around me. I fear there are other drivers out there who are unable to admit that and forced to comply and continue working under the higher stress levels. I also know quite a few drivers who are simply walking away from the industry because they are tired of the ever growing ridiculous regulations that keep being imposed on us. Some suggestions I have:- New drivers must use ELD's for a set amount of time.  Allowing experienced drivers to continue using paper logs. Granting    new drivers the option to log however they want after a set amount of time.- Eld's being forced upon carriers and/or operators who are found to be in violation multiple times- Altering the HOS to be more flexible- A standardized pay structure for truck drivers in general. Paid for all time in truck whether loading unloading or driving.- Higher training standards for new drivers trying to obtain their CDL.- We as people should be given a choice how we want to log our driving. I choose paper over electronics. I understand some prefer electronics and we should ALL be allowed to make that choice as until we are proven otherwise.",DOT-OST-2017-0069,Notice of Regulatory Review,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2017-0069-1513,Posted,Public Submission,1,TRUE,NA,2017-11-14T00:00:00-05:00,David Brown,Comment from David Brown,NA,Attachment contents : 1 Cite as: 575 U.

1060,DOT,FALSE,1,NA,2007-11-15T00:00:00-05:00,February 6 2009Department of TransportationOffice of the Secretary14 CFR Parts 234 259 and 399[Docket No. DOT-OST-2007-0022]RIN No. 2105-AD72Enhancing Airline Passenger ProtectionsThe National Business Travel Association (NBTA) submits the following comments in response to the Department of Transportation‰ЫЄs (DOT) Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) concerning its proposals to enhance airline passenger protections.  NBTA is the world‰ЫЄs premier business travel and corporate meetings organization. NBTA and its regional affiliates ‰ЫТ NBTA Asia Pacific the Brazilian Business Travel Association (ABGEV) NBTA Canada NBTA Mexico and NBTA USA ‰ЫТ serve a network of more than 15000 business travel professionals around the globe with industry-leading events networking education & professional development research news & information and advocacy. NBTA members numbering more than 4000 in 30 nations are corporate and government travel and meetings managers as well as travel service providers. They collectively manage and direct more than US$200 billion of global business travel and meetings expenditures annually on behalf of more than 10 million business travelers within their organizations.Through the efforts of its member committees and professional staff NBTA monitors developments in the business travel field and provides time-sensitive research and critical industry information.  The association also takes the industry‰ЫЄs story to the media and the public and represents the industry‰ЫЄs interests on Capitol Hill.  Committee to the advancement of the business travel profession NBTA offers numerous education and training opportunities and holds an annual International Convention and Exposition.  General CommentsDOT is seeking comment on whether it should adopt a rule to enhance airline passenger protections by requiring carriers to adopt contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays and incorporate them in their contract of carriage; require air carriers to respond to consumer problems; deem operating a chronically delayed flight to be unfair and deceptive; require carriers to publish delay data; require carriers to publish complaint data; require on-time performance reporting for international flights; and require carriers to audit their compliance with their customer service plans.The comments below are generally similar to those submitted by NBTA on January 22 2008.  Generally NBTA believes that customer service is a market-driven issue with purchasers able to make informed buying decisions based on facts related to airline service.  As certain types of information are only in the possession of air carriers NBTA generally supports greater transparency and reporting requirements so long as such requirements provide useful information to the airline passenger and/or their purchasing agent and can be conducted with reasonable costs.  Certain parts of the proposals in the proposed rule however do not meet that test.  Moreover while NBTA believes the federal government has an interest in mandating certain baseline consumer protections for airline customer service‰ЫУor ‰ЫПpassenger rights‰Ыќ‰ЫУin general airlines are in a much better position to ascertain what their customers expect and whether certain practices are worth the cost they entail.  Basic economics dictate that government mandates create private sector costs and those costs are going to be borne directly or indirectly by the traveling public.Contingency PlansDOT seeks comment whether an air carrier operating a domestic service should be required to develop and publish a contingency plan for long ground delays on the tarmac for all its flights and incorporate this plan into the contract of carriage.  Were this required DOT indicates that passengers would gain the opportunity to sue an airline if the airline did not abide by that plan.  Carriers would be required to retain for two years information related to on ground delays that lasted for at least four hours.  NBTA does not support generally requiring carriers to develop and publish contingency plans.  While NBTA supports carriers developing contingency plans and adopting recommendations set forth by the DOT Tarmac Delays Task Force actions regarding use and implementation of such plans should not be required by regulation.  NBTA believes that airlines that fail to adopt or utilize contingency plans are extremely likely to provide poor service to passengers in lengthy delay situations and such carrier are likely to be considered a much less desirable travel option.  Unfortunately the causes of any specific lengthy tarmac delay is likely to be a combination of fact-specific occurrences related to weather mechanical problems or other factors.  We continue to believe that an airline working through its pilot with local air traffic control and airport operators is more likely to resolve a tarmac delay in a manner most beneficial to the largest number of passengers than trying to resolve through previously-prepared scenarios.For a market driven approach to be effective NBTA does support requiring airlines to maintain and publish descriptions of lengthy tarmac delay situations.  Response to Consumer ProblemsThe proposed rule seeks comments on a series of new requirements for air carriers to respond to consumer complaints.  These proposals would require air carriers to designate an employee at every airport who is responsible for monitoring the effects of flight delays flight cancellations and lengthy tarmac delays on passengers and who has input on decisions such as which flights are subject to the longest delays.  Air carriers would also be required to publish all information necessary for filing a complaint with the airline.  Finally airlines would be required to send a response to each consumer complaint it receives within 30 days.  NBTA feels that this type of micromanagement of airlines customer service is unnecessary to meet the needs of business travelers.  Most if not all airlines have customer service departments specifically designed for this type of mission and have specific managers to handle key client needs.  Regulating a well-established practice would unnecessarily burden the air carriers and create duplicative and redundant services.  How carriers respond to flight cancellations and other service problems is a key factor by which purchasers make their buying decisions.  Therefore NBTA believes that diverting attention away from this business relationship to meet government-mandated solutions would be an unproductive endeavor.  The cost of creating new customer service positions at each airport is also of great concern to NBTA.  Requiring airlines to enhance their physical customer service at airports may divert resources from customer service methods such as customer service available by Internet or phone that are more efficient for carriers to administer.   Chronically Delayed Flights as ViolationsThe proposed rule would require a ‰Ычchronically delayed flight‰ЫЄ as a flight that operates at least 45 times per quarter and is more than 15 minutes late 70% of the time.  NBTA supports this new proposal as a helpful ‰ЫПbright line‰Ыќ standard that will force air carriers to meet baseline performance standards in order to advertise a flight.  The proposed rule accurately states: ‰ЫПConsumers‰ЫЄ reliance on chronically inaccurate schedules works in their detriment both personally and professionally.‰Ыќ  One of the key recommendations made by the DOT Inspector General‰ЫЄs office at several Congressional hearings was to provide DOT the tools and recourses to adequately pursue passenger‰ЫЄs rights issues.  NBTA supports adding this additional legal tool to the Secretary‰ЫЄs disposal. Require Carriers to Publish Delay Data on their Web SitesThe proposed rule would require airlines and travel agencies to provide on-time performance information on their websites as part of customers‰ЫЄ online transactions for purchasing tickets.  NBTA supports requiring carriers to provide performance data to prospective purchasers so long as these requirements are aligned with performance reports that carriers must file with DOT.  NBTA recognizes that DOT is conducting an additional rule-making related to flight delays and encourages DOT to align the requirements that might emerge from that rule-making with any new mandates in this area.  Require Carriers to Publish Complaint Data on their Web SitesThe proposed rule would require that carriers publish an aggregate count of specific complaints filed by passengers on their Web sites.  While NBTA appreciates the spirit of advancing transparency in the rule requiring an air carrier to specifically highlight its complaints does not appear to offer meaningful value to prospective purchasers.  Many complaints would not fall into simple categories easily classified into aggregate data fields.  Furthermore categorization of complaints would fail to distinguish the severity and rational of complaints.  For example the proposed rule does not appear to require distinction between problems caused purely by airline issues and those that are the result of some uncontrollable factor such as the weather.  The ambiguity of complaint classification would also lead carriers to adopt disparate standards which would make enforcement problematic.  In addition many complaints are resolved over a period of time requiring a constant reshuffling of data fields and arbitrary decisions whether a specific complaint was resolved.  Require Carriers to Report On-Time Performance of International FlightsThe proposed rule would require foreign carriers to report on-time performance for international flights.  NBTA supports this requirement as a reasonable mechanism to bring greater transparency to a growing market of increasing significance to NBTA and its international partners.  NBTA encourages DOT however to align any new reporting requirements as much as possible with current requirements applicable to purely domestic flights.  In addition to the extent such information can be communicated via transmissions mechanisms already in place for other purposes such as the Advanced Passenger Information System the new requirement may be implemented in a cost-effective manner.  Carriers‰ЫЄ Adherence to Customer Service PlansThe proposed rule would require carriers to audit their adherence to their own customer service plans.  It also seeks comment whether carriers who do not have such plans should be required to adopt one and what might be included and whether they should be incorporated in their contract of carriage.  It is difficult to imagine that self-audits of customer service plans will create significant credibility for such plans.  NBTA supports providing the DOT IG with resources to conduct audits of carrier customer service whether they have adopted a specific plan or not to improve public information about airline performance.  However recognizing the cost of compliance NBTA suggests that such audits be conducted no greater than every three years and that they be conducted at similar times in the year to provide accurate comparative information.  As mentioned under the issues of contingency plans NBTA believes that customer service is best left to market forces subject to the baseline passenger rights.  Retroactive Applicability of Amendments to Contracts of CarriageDOT seeks comments on whether customers on the same flight should be subject to the same contract of carriage if changes or amendments occurred between passengers‰ЫЄ purchases.NBTA believes that customers flying on the same flight should be subject to the same contract of carriage terms regardless of when their ticket was purchased.  Often times business travelers schedule their trips at the last minute and should not be subjected to different regulations due to the nature of their business.Such a practice could have potentially detrimental effects to airline customer service as well.  Providing customers on various flights with different responses and compensation would complicate the process and likely require additional staffing in airline customer service departments. Effective DateThe proposed rule would require airlines to adopt plans for compliance within 180 days of the publishing date of the final rule.  It seeks comments on whether that gives airlines sufficient time for implementation.  If implemented some of the rules would require significant changes to airline practices resulting in the need for additional implementation time.  NBTA believes a reasonable effective date should be established by DOT after determining the impact the final rule will have on air carriers.  ,DOT-OST-2007-0022,Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2007-0022-0235,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,National Business Travel Association,2009-02-09T00:00:00-05:00,NA,National Business Travel Association,2105-AD72,NA,NA,"Attachment Contents : ...Were this required, DOT indicates that passengers would gain the opportunity to <endeca_term>sue</endeca_term> an airline if the airline did not abide by that plan.

Ray LaHoodSecretary of TransportationU.S. Department of Transportation1200 New Jersey Avenue S.E.Washington D.C. 20590Subject:Comments of FlyersRights.org on NPRM?Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections?Reference:14 CFR Parts 234 253 259 and 399Docket No. DOT-OST-2007-0022RIN No. 2105-AD72SUBJECT:The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) opposes the subject NPRM (Item 1) as an unlawful delegation of DOT authority and responsibility to regulate airlines in the public interest by delegating this function the airlines themselves.  As written it is an anti-consumer regulation that would take away existing common law tort rights of airline passengers for false imprisonment and negligence in situations of long confinements on the tarmac of 3-11 hours that airlines now subject approximately 300000 passengers a year to and substitute an unenforceable contract cause of action.  ACAP supports Items 2-7 of the NPRM. Dear Secretary LaHood:The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) was founded in 1971 as 501(c ) 3 nonprofit organization that acts as voice for air travelers on issues of safety security and airline consumer rights and interests.  It has held longstanding membership on the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) and the Aviation Security Advisory Committee.  We have testified before Congress on the issues in this NPRM and filed comments with DOT.  I have been executive director of ACAP since 1997 and as an attorney have represented ACAP individual consumers and Flyersrights.org (fka the Coalition for an Airline Passengers Bill of Rights) in the federal and state courts on the issues addressed in this NRPM.1.  Putting Contingency Plans in the Contract of Carriage.This NPRM (1) is a last gasp Bush Administration/Airline Industry effort to turn over DOT regulatory authority to the regulated party.  It would lead to a multiplicity of unenforceable ?standards? and ?plans.?  Some airlines already are using a 4 to 6 hour guideline for tarmac confinements.  As there is presently no federal standard state common law standards for negligence and false imprisonment state criminal statutes involving unsafe operation of aircraft and wrongful imprisonment or reckless endangerment and possibly constitutional protections against unreasonable seizure are the only legal protections airline passengers have against indefinite tarmac confinements.  Most airlines now have or claim to have contingency plans to deal with flight disruptions of more than 2 hours.  But they are vague and commonly ignored (e.g. American Airlines has a contingency plan that is supposed to be activated after a 2 hours of delay but it was been found by the OIG to have been ignored and violated repeatedly in a Sept. 2007 report of its 12/29/06 mass diversion and stranding of over 100 flights involving over 10000 passengers).  Such plans are vague and there is nothing in them that a airline passenger can really enforce in a contract action.  Such plans placed in the contract of carriage would just be another way for airlines to absolve themselves of responsibility for long tarmac delays diversions and confinements.These confinements of 3- 11 hours now affect approximately 300000 passengers per year and have led to a national outcry and the formation of a national grass roots organization Flyersrights.org with over 24000 members.  The claims of the Air Transport Association that tarmac confinements have declined are false or at least unproven.  The DOT BTS only recently began collecting these statistics in 2008 and has had to remove the data presented by the airlines as ?corrupted? and therefore unreliable.The proposed regulation would wipe out existing legal protections and in our view would lead to more not less tarmac confinements as each airline would be in effect be able to write its own rule.  Such an unlawful delegation of DOT regulatory authority  would no doubt be challenged in court.   The age of self-regulation and deregulation whether in the financial industry air safety food safety or airline consumer protection is over.  It has been thoroughly discredited by scandals and disasters over the past two years and even rejected by many of its former advocates.  The Obama DOT must reject the mantra of former DOT Secretary Peters that the ?market? will solve all consumer problems.  Senator and Candidate Obama endorsed airline passenger rights legislation that would outlaw tarmac confinements of over 3 hours which this NPRM would clearly not do.  When an airline passenger brings an action in state court  the airline almost invariably has it removed to federal court on grounds of federal preemption.  The defendant airline will then file a series of motions to have the case transferred to its home state often far from the consumer passenger?s residence.  The cost of such litigation far exceeds the individual claims for ordinary delays or tarmac confinements.  The airlines are generally successful in having such lawsuits dismissed discouraged or abandoned.  Indeed a review of cases under CCH Aviation cases shows that virtually the only breach of contract cases brought under the contracts of carriage successfully involve cargo shipments by commercial shippers.   You can view the many technical defenses Recent cases involving passenger strandings which include  Ray v American Airlines Inc. US DC WD AR 08-5072 Hanni v American Airlines Inc. US DC ND CA 08-732; Harper v American Airlines Inc. US DC ND AL 08-________ (filed 12/29/08); Biscone v JetBlue Airways Corp. NYS SC Queens Co. 3776/2008.  The motions to dismiss or transfer or for summary judgment filed by the airline defendants can be viewed online at Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) or the electronic dockets of the New York State Uniform Court System web site.Under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) (perhaps better described as the Consumer Class Action Elimination Act of 2005) nearly all state consumer class actions (which involves any case with a potential total claim over $5 Million) are removed to federal court where the bar is so high for certification that very few consumer class actions have ever been certified since this statute went into effect.  In the 5th Circuit which is the home of American Southwest and Continental Airlines none have been certified.  As to the issue of tarmac confinements only one 1999 case against Northwest Airlines has been certified as a class action to our knowledge and that occurred in Michigan state court involving confinements of up to 9 hours of 4000 passengers prior to the enactment of CAFA. Only through class actions in federal court or in local small claims court is it possible for airline passengers to judicially enforce breach of contract to tort claims that do not involve serious physical injury or death.  And since a class action requires that many passengers be involved with common facts and law only mass stranding events would normally qualify.Some airlines already provide for compensation for delays and associated expenses of overnight lodging in their contracts of carriage but these provisions are not as a practical matter enforceable and are frequently ignored or avoided entirely by airlines coding nearly every delayed or canceled flight as weather or FAA Air Traffic Control related.  There is no effective oversight by DOT and no fines of substance for airline violation of their own contracts or customer service plans or contingency plans or internal policies and none seems likely in the foreseeable future.The NPRM if adopted would mean domestic US airline passengers would have rights inferior to those provided to international passengers under the Montreal Convention of 1999.  Under Art. 19 passengers may recover damages for delay of up to  about $6400 on a near strict liability basis.  An airline to avoid liability has the burden of proving that it took all reasonable steps to avoid the delay or that the delay was impossible to avoid.  Damages include compensation for inconvenience as well as out of pocket losses and this treaty overrides the limitations or exclusions commonly found in domestic airline contracts of carriage which make promises in those contracts largely illusory.  Should NPRM (Item 1) be adopted in any form it should include provisions in domestic contracts of carriage a) requiring payment of litigation expenses of the passenger should s/he substantially prevail in the lawsuit b) be no less favorable to domestic passengers than international passengers c) should specifically authorize suits in state as well as federal courts d) authorize class actions where appropriate with the consumer class representative receiving a reasonable sum in compensation his time and representational responsibilities of the class payment of class notification expenses by the airline defendant plus treble damages or minimum compensation of  four times the ticket price and e) have a hard 3 hour passenger right to deplane plus delay compensation of $10 per minute for on ground confinements over 3 hours. Only with such pro-consumer provisions will airlines have an incentive to change their existing practices of ignoring passenger complaints and claims with impunity or offering only token compensation such as discount coupons or restricted vouchers.Items 2-7.  ACAP has long advocated for Truth in Scheduling regulation as a first line of defense against congestion delays caused by over scheduling by airlines.  These proposed measures are in line with our recommendations and would address the No. 1 airline passenger complaint:  flight delays.   As scheduling has been decontrolled airlines now have incentives to unrealistically schedule flights at popular times for competitive reasons which in turn leads to unnecessary congestion at major choke point airports like NYC and Chicago.  These regulations should allow consumers to avoid chronically delayed flights should eliminate deceptively scheduled flights and help relieve congestion delays at choke point airports.

Thus we support the proposals in the NPRM butbelieve they should be strengthened.Specifically we are opposed to the DOT concept that would turn Federalregulatory authority over to individual airlines -- who would each decide howmuch protection to offer airline passengers stuck on airline aircraft atairports for many hours.  In lieu of setting minimum Federal standards forairlines to provide water food working restrooms comfortable cabintemperatures and an option to deplane when it is safe to do so DOT is proposingto let each U.S. airline set its own guidelines without any Federal review andapproval.National Consumer Groups 19 March 2009 Page 2 of 2Notice of Proposed Rule Making:  Enhancing Airline Passenger ProtectionsReference:14 CFR Parts 234 253 259 and 399Docket No. DOT-OST-2007-0022RIN No. 2105-AD72We support the recommendations of FlyersRights.org in the extensive commentsthey filed on March 9 on each of the sections of the NPRM.

1093,DOT,FALSE,1,NA,2011-09-19T00:00:00-04:00,Accessibility of air travel continues to be an important public policy objective but does not permit defective and misleading economic analysis. It is reasonable for DOT to phase in standards for website accessibility while minimizing industry compliance cost.  We recommend that DOT limit the scope of Level AA compliance to the pages associated with booking managing or changing a reservation and provide a minimum two-year window for implementation prior to the first effective date.  But DOT‰ЫЄs proposed changes for airport kiosk accessibility are unreasonable and unjustified. 14 CFR 382.57 requires airlines to offer individuals with disabilities priority ‰ЫПfront of the line‰Ыќ access to check-in counters and agents and DOT has documented no failures that necessitate further regulatory action.  Its proposed solution (full kiosk accessibility) raises important safety and welfare questions for the general public.  Our comments focus on six problems with the SNPRM.  First policies that drive consumers to online/kiosk transactions will result in loss of airline jobs.  Second there are inherent safety considerations for all passengers related to fully automated check-in by individuals with visual disabilities.  Third website and kiosk use by individuals with visual disabilities may be slower than interaction with a call center or airport desk.  Fourth fundamental errors in the supplied Preliminary Regulatory Analysis result in overstated benefits and understated costs.  Fifth implementation timetables proposed are unrealistically short.  Sixth it is impractical to hold airlines liable for accessibility of independent agency websites or to jointly and severally penalize airlines and airports for common-use kiosks.   ,DOT-OST-2011-0177,Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel: Accessibility of Web Site and Automated Kiosks at U.S. Airports,Rulemaking,DOT-OST-2011-0177-0076,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,American Aviation Institute,2012-01-03T00:00:00-05:00,NA,American Aviation Institute,2105-AD96,Attachment Contents : ...certain advocacy groups that have unsuccessfully litigated for absolute equality though state <endeca_term>courts</endeca_term>.

I am speaking for myself and not for any government entity.(a) A brief description of your application(s) of positioning navigation and timing services;Having served earlier in my career as a ship's officer primarily aboard U.S. coast-wise tankers I came to quickly appreciate the critical necessity for navigation positioning and the benefits of electronic satellite and loran systems.  I have learned first-hand how important it is to know your ship's exact location especially in shallow areas where a high speed vessel proceeding in excess of 20 knots can run into difficulty in a mere matter of minutes.  As a Master aboard these tankers my appreciation for accurate electronic positioning understandably became more acute.  As a private pilot with FAA single engine high horsepower rating as well as an avid small boat owner I know that electronic positioning is not just a concern for large tankers just off the rocky shores of the U.S. coastline.  Large ships that go aground on our shores can inflict severe consequences in magnitudes almost beyond comprehension.  The oil spill this past week off Santa Barbara is yet another grim reminder of the extreme and long-lasting damaging effects of oil to the marine environment.  The 2010 BP blowout of the DEEPWATER HORIZON in the Gulf of Mexico reached a cost to BP in excess of 42 billion US dollars by 2013.  A VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) also can spill significant amounts of oil.  These vessels come to our shores every day.  Vessels deliver dangerous cargoes besides oil daily via our environment.We are aware this wayward oil does not have to be the ship's cargo to cause serious harm since the engine fuel (bunkers) alone is carried in such large quantities that damage to a single bunker tank can have significant impacts as we have seen on numerous occasions off our shores and others.   If a CONUS eLoran system were implemented only to serve the marine transportation sector it would be a very wise investment for this use solely.  The known cost of a single medium size oil spill from vessel grounding may very well run into the same hundreds of millions of dollars that it is anticipated to cost to implement and run CONUS eLoran for 20 years.  Preventing one oil spill could pay for the system for 20+ years!  For comparison a single GPS satellite costs this type of money by the time it is designed bid built and launched.  As a complementary navigation positioning source eLoran would be a very worthwhile investment.  As many know the PNT acronym's most important letter has morphed from its early days assisting with positioning and timing to become the super-critical (T)imekeeper of the world.As a professor at a maritime academy I have a enhanced appreciation for PNT systems and particularly GPS due to the timekeeping aspects.  Since I use many parts of the U.S. critical infrastructure daily it seems fair to say that outlining ""A brief description of your application(s) of positioning navigation and timing services"" for me would not be unlike most other U.S. citizens who use electricity telecommunications and banking etc. every day.  This would be especially critical if ""(b) the positioning navigation and/or timing performance required for a complementary PNT capability to support operations during a disruption of GPS that could last for longer than a day"".Since the timing aspect of PNT has largely become more important than the positioning aspect and so inherently crucial to everything we do how could we not immediately implement a second system for timing in the form of eLoran? (c) availability and coverage area required for a complementary PNT capability;Coverage needs to be similar to GPS so the two systems can be universally and uniformly relied upon to support the same system and user demands at similar tolerances. Since GPS (and all GNSS including GLONASS Galileo etc.) are satellite based and eLoran is terrestrially based this would be the very best of partnerships.  The two systems GPS and eLoran are so very different in transmission frequencies signal power vulnerabilities etc. that they have quite different failure modes - what impacts one will probably not impact the other.  Please see the attachment describing the units used in the English Channel for years now that automatically switch from one system to the other during failures. To accomplish this uniformity between systems for both timing and positioning (about 8-10 meters?) coverage would need to extend throughout the Alaska/CONUS coastlines and include those ""fringe"" areas where present geometry of eLoran stations requires stations in Canada and Mexico some new. These areas like the Florida Keys Gulf of Mexico and southern California areas would seem to require two new stations in northern Mexico perhaps totaling 35-45 stations.",DOT-OST-2015-0053,Notice of Request for Public Comment,Nonrulemaking,DOT-OST-2015-0053-0164,Posted,Public Submission,1,FALSE,NA,2015-05-27T00:00:00-04:00,David Moskoff,David Moskoff,NA,Attachment Contents : ...Sheets Venue Hire Rooms Welcome Entrance Hall The Staircase The Quarterdeck The <endeca_term>Court</endeca_term> Room The Library The Pepys Room The Luncheon Room The Reading Room...,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Gawelko M.S. CEO and Founder of Service Dog Express LLC P.O. Box 591835 San Antonio TX  78259. Email: laurie@servicedogexpress.com Phone: (855)778-2364 ext.1.I received my Master's Degree in Canine Life Sciences from Bergin University for Canine Studies in 2012 and my undergraduate degree from Carnegie Mellon University in Social History with a minor in Psychology in 2005. After receiving my undergraduate degree I worked in many distinguished psychiatric research hospitals focusing on treating patients with a variety of psychiatric disorders. After completing my Master's degree I founded Service Dog Express LLC which to date has paired over 1000 Wounded Warriors and civilians with a multitude of disabilities with professionally-trained Service Dogs.  One of the issues that I have been consistently advocating for since the inception of my company is to have the ACAA follow the same regulations regarding the definition of 'Service Dogs' that the ADA announced in 2011. The ADA NO LONGER had a separate classification for ""Psychiatric Service Dogs"" - they were put under the all-encompassing rubric of ""Service Dogs"". Simply put the term ""Psychiatric Service Dog"" DOES NOT EXIST.  However the ACAA continues to disregard this change in terminology and airlines consistently demand documentation from those who fly with Service Dogs that aid those with psychological disabilities that they do not require from those who fly with Service Dogs for ""visible disabilities"" including mobility issues Guide Dogs Hearing Dogs and medical alert dogs (epilepsy diabetes etc.). This is in direct violation of ADA law and is an absolute infringement on the rights of those who have such issues as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Traumatic Brain Injuries anxiety disorders etc. Based upon this blatant discrimination and failure of the ACAA to align themselves with the ADA I began working on a regular basis with then United States Senator John Cornyn Congressman Pete P. Gallego and State Representative Jose Mendendez to actively address this issue receiving letters of commendation from all.  In fact by the end of 2013 my work with Senator Cornyn had reached the point where he informed me that this issue would be drafted by him as a bill to be presented to Congress due to its extreme importance. Unfortunately as the political environment changed the issue was inevitably put on a ""back burner"" - but I have continued my correspondence with all of these previously engaged political figures as the issue continued to be unresolved. I also vowed to all of my clients with psychological disabilities that I would pursue this issue until it was resolved appropriately and in accordance with ADA Federal Law. Having participated in several research projects in which I was able to view the S.P.E.C.T. scans and PET scans of individuals with psychological disabilities it was and is very clear that these are CLINICALLY DIAGNOSTIC MEDICAL CHANGES in patients brains. Psychological disabilities are medical disabilities just like any other medical disability. Through my work with Wounded Warriors with PTSD Traumatic Brain Injuries and clients with other psychological disabilities who have professionally-trained Service Dogs it has come to the point in my company that ANY time a client with an aforementioned disability who needs to fly on a commercial airline has to book their flight say that they are flying with a Medical Alert Service Dog and I then without fail call the airline with which they are flying to confirm again that my client is flying with a Medical Alert Service Dog will require NO additional documentation of their ""disability"" and will not be treated any differently than any other person flying with a Service Dog.  Service Dogs for people with psychological disabilities perform tasks that do medically alert to changes in the chemistry of the brain by providing such things as deep pressure therapy (which immediately positively alters the client's brain chemistry) pawing to alert to a client if they are experiencing a panic attack flashback moment of disassociation ""covering"" (which is essentially providing a barrier between the client and any threat to the client's psychological well-being) and constantly increasing the client's levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and the levels of oxytocin in the brain that keep the client calm.  The ACAA MUST recognize that a Service Dog is a Service Dog no matter what the client's disability is - and each client with a disability should be treated equally and they should never be subjected to the utter humiliation and degradation especially of those who have served our country and suffer from PTSD or TBI by asking for paperwork documenting their private psychiatric diagnoses.
