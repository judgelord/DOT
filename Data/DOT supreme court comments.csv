"1","DOT",FALSE,0,"2017-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","2017-10-02T00:00:00-04:00","  What is an ELD? It is an electronic logging device that was designed to micromanage large fleets and their drivers performance and productivity.   These devices are to be used as a device for logging a drivers daily hours. Driving time on duty not driving time sleeper berth and off duty. Drivers are afforded a 14 hour day to work. Of that 14 hours they are limited to 11 hours driving. They must also take a mandatory 30 minute ""break"" in the first 8 hours. When the 14 hours are up they are required to take a 10 hour break. Once the clock starts; it doesn't stop for anything. How is this wrong one might ask. Before the straight 14 hour rule; drivers had what was known as split sleeper berth. More rested and safer.  The reason the ELD was developed was because certain large carriers had such horrible safety records the government said they ""had to do something"" to improve their records. These companies safety records are still horrible by the way. How do they ""improve"" their safety records? Well for them they purchase excess equipment keep it legally registered and your accident ratio drops per 100 or 1000.   Being self insured allows the mega carrier to hire freshly graduated students from trucking schools (10 days to 4 weeks training). They then place the graduates with less than all seasons experienced trainers. (4 months in some instances). They then place these ""teams"" on the highways with the general public. This is a recipe for disaster.  An organization known as the ATA (which stands for American Trucking Association) lobbied for this mandate. This organization claims to be the ""authoritative voice of the trucking industry"". While in actuality they represent less than 20% of the industry. The other 80% is comprised of small business owners. (1-20 trucks). They pushed the mandate through under claims of safety. This device has nothing to do with safety. It only monitors what the truck is doing. The safety of the vehicle relies solely on the operator.   How is this an unjust law? It targets owners of vehicles with engines manufactured after a certain date. It has exemptions. These ""exemptions"" alone are proof that the mandate is flawed.   This mandate is an infringement (borderline at the very least) on the 4th and 5th Amendment rights of the constitution of the United States. It places a ""proverbial"" electronic tracking device on your vehicle. The Supreme Court ruled that this practice was not lawful in cases against convicted criminals. Yet they can do it to truckers. (The Supreme Court refused to hear the case).   How do you ensure a multi billion dollar industry will be successful? You mandate it. Then you collect money from hard working men and women to fund it. There are 3.97 million trucks on the highways. Take a conservative figure of 3 million. Then use an average monthly service fee of $32. Multiply those two figures and it equates to $96 million. Multiply that by 12 and you get in excess of 1 billion dollars. That is just for the service fee per year.  This mandate places an unnecessary expense on certain truck owners. Again making it an unjust law.   The ATA with no factual proof estimates that these devices will save 26 lives per year. This estimate is within the margin of error in any poll of 1000. With no factual proof; these devices cannot be referred to as safety items. Remember they are micromanagement tools.   In the passing of this mandate; the government has taken business decisions and freedoms away from small business owners. Now the government wants to micromanage them.   It is a fact by their own statistics that 80% of all accidents involving commercial vehicles and automobiles are caused by the automobile. This was the finding of both the ATA and NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). Yet the trucking industry is punished for them.   There are concerns of cyber security associated with the devices. These units plug in to the ECM of the vehicle. (Electronic control module). This gains the device access to all of the vehicle's functions. The device has the capability to send and receive messages. Can the device be hacked? Why would anyone want to? 80000lbs is a large projectile. Especially if it's a HazMat load. Maybe just a desirable commodity.   It would be better served for safety sake to mandate that ALL vehicles be required to be equipped with breathalyzers and data suspension devices. (Hands free calls only). There would quite possibly be tens of thousands of lives saved on the highways per year.   How do you think you would feel if your vehicle were being electronically tracked 24/7? Without a warrant not committing a crime. Just being tracked. Then at your expense you would feel your rights and freedoms had been violated.  In closing I would like to add that this mandate was never about safety. Moreover about money and control.","DOT-OST-2017-0069","Notice of Regulatory Review","Nonrulemaking","DOT-OST-2017-0069-2589","Posted","Public Submission",1,TRUE,"2017-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","Riley Clay","Comment from Riley  Clay",NA,NA,NA

This is being pushed by the ATA because the mega carriers want to put the small guys all out of business; this is what it is intended for.  The added cost of ELDs are easily absorbed for the mega carriers but it is an added burden on the small independent carriers in an industry that is already nickel and diming us every day.Forcing all Truck Drivers to be GPS tracked with ELDs/EOBRs is a gross violation of our 4th amendment rights. The Supreme Court has ruled twice that it is a violation of privacy rights granted in the 4th amendment. Truckers haven't done anything wrong we should not be tracked like criminals. The ELDs have been proven to be high risk for hacking and cyber attacks. Lets be real while I always follow the hours of service rules there are times that there is a need for flexibility. Sometimes situations out of our control means we need an extra 10 minutes to get to a safe parking spot or our clock runs out wile getting loaded and the shipper says we need to get off the property or you my find yourself in an ice storm. ELDs will not allow that flexibility and will push drivers into making dangerous decisions out of fear of HOS violations instead of putting their personal and public safety first.THE PEOPLE MAKING THESE RULES GO HOME EVERYDAY.

Everyone has different sleep patterns and no one rule can change that or make it safer. The ELD violates privacy rights as the supreme court themthemselves has ruled on per tracking without a warrant.  I think SELF insurers should be done away with so the DOT can see the real accident RATES of companies not just the ones they choose to report. This is a revenue problem that the large companies are trying to solve through the lobbying of the ATA (just look at their 5 yr annua revenuel reports) none of which have any experience behind the wheel of a semi truck. I mind you it all looks good on paper but at some point practical applicati9j has to take the place of information and the real world application does not account for all of the daily hurdles faced in the industry. There are also questions of safety and the ability to be hacked as the University of Michigan pointed out in a study done where they were able to control the trucks wirelessless while the driver was driving.  This could be the single largest threat to the US in a way like no other the scenarios are endless and very disturbing to think about. More truck WITH ELDS WRECK THAN WITHOUT them which was also proven by the DOT data. You want safety then correct the environment the drivers have to work in. Correct the class D DRIVERS abilities and make test more thorough to pass and require more conditions to be set.

I feel that forcing this mandate upon everyone is going to be a major burden on the industry.  The cost alone for smaller truck companies and independent owner operators to comply is a pretty big burden in itself.  Many of these carrier have done nothing wrong and have clean safety records. I believe that criminals are granted a trial before 24/7 electronic monitoring is granted as an option to jail time. Why are trucking companies or independent operators being forced to be monitored 24/7 when they've done nothing wrong?  I also believe that it has been ruled that sex offenders aren't even allowed to be monitored 24/7. As can be seen in attached pages. So essentially this mandate is treating us as tho we are worse than criminals.  I certainly can understand eld devices being used voluntarily if operators would like to use them. Also I would understand them being forced upon carriers who continuously violate the laws.  The idea that ELD's are going to make the roads safer and save lives has also no been proven. In fact accidents have gone up the past few years.  Some of the highest accident rates are found in the very carriers who are already using Eld's. If safety was really of concern you would remove companies ability to self insure their units.  A perfect example of this is Swift.  Other issues that are going to be exposed with an ELD mandate is the lack of parking.  First and foremost at shippers and receivers.  Many of them simply do no allow trucks to come in early or stay after being loaded or unloaded. This creates issues with the mandatory 10 hour break.  While many will argue this is an HOS issue.  I feel that shippers are receivers need to be held to a higher standard Federally.  Some are now imposing fines for missing appointment times or simply tell drivers ""we will get to you when we can"".  How are we supposed to plan for that? Further delaying our work week and our next load. Mind you. Unless we are loaded and moving we are not making money.  I do believe the HOS is an issue that should be adjusted.  With more flexibility in that the ELD would be easier to adapt to.  Also pertaining to ELD's I don't understand what is wrong with the paper system. Monetarily it costs next to nothing for us to comply with paper.  There is also no security risks involved with the paper system. Security becomes an issue with ELD devices tied into the ECM's of the trucks we are operating.  The systems my employer are using uses bluetooth technology. Which is even easier to hack.  While I'm not the best at putting my thoughts into words I've done my best here to summarize them.  The ELD mandate is going to add more stress to a job that I thoroughly enjoy up until the worry about this mandate.  I have started to question whether I will be able to continue doing this job that I enjoy and was expecting to retire from.  The added stress this device is going to put on me with racing a 14 hour clock while safely operating a commercial vehicles in the Northeast corridor is not safe for me or those around me. I fear there are other drivers out there who are unable to admit that and forced to comply and continue working under the higher stress levels. I also know quite a few drivers who are simply walking away from the industry because they are tired of the ever growing ridiculous regulations that keep being imposed on us. Some suggestions I have:- New drivers must use ELD's for a set amount of time.  Allowing experienced drivers to continue using paper logs. Granting    new drivers the option to log however they want after a set amount of time.- Eld's being forced upon carriers and/or operators who are found to be in violation multiple times- Altering the HOS to be more flexible- A standardized pay structure for truck drivers in general. Paid for all time in truck whether loading unloading or driving.- Higher training standards for new drivers trying to obtain their CDL.- We as people should be given a choice how we want to log our driving. I choose paper over electronics. I understand some prefer electronics and we should ALL be allowed to make that choice as until we are proven otherwise.","DOT-OST-2017-0069","Notice of Regulatory Review","Nonrulemaking","DOT-OST-2017-0069-1513","Posted","Public Submission",1,TRUE,"2017-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","David Brown","Comment from David Brown","Attachment s : 1 Cite as: 575 U.

Konexial is convinced that the ELD rule will improve safety for the trucking industry and will provide carriers and shippers to gain significant cost savings through Dynamic Load Matching by having the ability to find freight transactions based on geographic and economic shared interest. The ELD rule is the culmination of nearly a decade of work between government business and technology to improve the safety compliance and competitiveness of the trucking industry. The FMCSA has done an admirable job working with carriers to phase in this technology over a 4-year period of time. The industry was given the final rule in December of 2015 which provided 2 years for carriers to plan and implement ELD technology. Further FMCSA granted carriers with older AOBRD technology an additional 2 years (December 2019) to transition to the newer ELD technology and has granted an 8 day exemption for the truck rental and leasing market.The ELD rule has undergone relentless challenge in numerous federal courts including the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which was the most recent court to reject arguments opposing the ELD mandate. The US Supreme Court has also declined to hear any further objections to the ELD rule.The interests of the trucking industry shippers the US economy and the traveling public are all served by the implementation of ELD technology.  The only parties still opposing the ELD rule are those that want the ability to break the Hours of Service rules common to all carriers without being recorded. Konexial stands with the American Trucking Association (ATA) in calling for implementation of the ELD rule as planned for December 18 2017.It's time to move the industry forward.RespectfullyKen EvansCEOKonexial","DOT-OST-2017-0069","Notice of Regulatory Review","Nonrulemaking","DOT-OST-2017-0069-0351","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2017-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","Ken Evans","Comment from Ken Evans",NA,NA,NA

The ELD simply converts what should have been happening with a driver's Hours of Service (HOS) on paper logs into an electronic form.  There has not been a new law passed simply a modernization of how those hours are recorded.  The 'flexibility' that many proponents of a delay wish to use as a rallying cry is in reality - illegal logging of hours - and this creates risk for drivers carriers and shippers.  As a carrier and fleet operator there are many businesses that have not delayed on action to adopt to the new format of logging electronically.  Delaying this implementation will unfairly punish those carriers that were proactive and invested in their businesses.The current push from OOIDA to delay implementation is an end around attempt that is inherently unfair to all competitors in the marketplace and uses hyperbole to undermine the research substantiated in 2014 that found that ELD use reduced crashes by 11.7 percent and saw a 50% drop in hours of service violations.  Law enforcement including the Fraternal Order of Police the National Sheriffs' Association and the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) have all come out in favor of the rule and strongly oppose any delay in implementation as does our organization.FMCSA's estimate of a $3.01 billion benefit from this rule resulting from crash reductions and a decreased paperwork burden more than offsets the costs of implementation.  In fact the net benefit of this rule-making is estimated at $1.18 billion.  I have seen this advantage in my fleet with reduced amount of time for my drivers to record their hours of service as well as back office time of scanning logs reviewing illegible copies and the amount of scanning and storage required.  As for complaints that it will be too expensive or an overall burden financially there are many low-cost solutions that small carriers can employ to be in compliance.Many of the carriers and economic groups that are concerned about the ELD implementation are in the Agriculture transportation sector.  All of the freight that our organization runs is in the Agriculture segment.  There are many customers and carriers that have skirted (at best) the current HOS rules.  Long dwell times and lack of detention pay by the agricultural customers have created a culture in the agricultural transportation world that has led many of the small owner operator businesses to believe that if they lose the 'flexibility' of paper logs there business will not be viable.  As an agricultural shipper who has run ELD's for the past year the reality is that it can be done.  There still needs to be changes in the delays that carriers but higher rates do to long dwell times will help fix that issue.  Free market forces will correct bad behavior from carriers and shippers.Finally Congress passed ELD legislation in 2012 so there has been knowledge of this regulation coming for five years.  OOIDA's (and the many owner operators they represent) claim that they have not had enough time to prepare for this implementation is at its basis a flawed argument.  You don't get to sue over the rule and take it all the way to the supreme court (to not even be heard because there was no merit) and then claim you did not have enough time to prepare for the rule implementation.SincerelyTim SayersCOORFG Trucking Inc.","DOT-OST-2017-0069","Notice of Regulatory Review","Nonrulemaking","DOT-OST-2017-0069-0336","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2017-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","Tim Sayers","Comment from RFG Trucking, Inc.",NA,NA,NA

And under the Supreme Court case US vs Jones (2012) a tracking device on a vehicle to monitor a vehicle's movement constitutes a search under the Forth Amendment.

Bottom line is the ELD should not be a one size fits all. If a member of the ATA wants an ELD in their truck(s) than so be it.

Taking into account the loss in employment in other non-manufacturing sectors the job-equivalents impact for the overall industrial sector could be about 1.1 million job-equivalents in 2025 and 6.5 million in 2040.

In the core scenario U.S. GDP loss could be about $250 billion in 2025 increasing to about $420 billion per year on average and a cumulative loss of about $4 trillion between 2022 and 2031. The losses become larger in the long run as the ""mid-term"" deep decarbonization target constrains the economy significantly. The U.S. economy could lose about 6% of its GDP on average between 2034 and 2040 amounting to a loss of greater than $2 trillion annually and a cumulative loss of $14 trillion. The most energy and carbon intensive sectors experience the greatest impacts. As a result of the GHG policy these sectors face high costs and become globally uncompetitive leading to lower demand for their goods.

They have implemented a law called the ELD LAW.This law is basically states that all trucks of a 2000 model year or newer have till December 18th this year to equip trucks with a electronic logging device. I understand the concern of the Supreme Court and why they would want such a law to be in effect. Safety is a big issue on Americas roads today. The Fatigued Driving excuse they used to help push this law through is untrue. The (OOIDA) OWNER OPERATORS INDEPENDENT DRIVERS ASSOCIATION Filed an appeal or a request for their appeal to be heard in the Supreme Court. As I understand it the Court's final decision was to basically look past the request of (OOIDA) to appeal the ELD law. The courts denied there request to take it to the court rooms where the voices of American truck drivers voices should have been and needed to be heard. There is alot of controversy when it comes to this ELD Law. Those of you who put this law I to effect with no other reason then to reduce Fatigued drivers on our roads need to look at the actual numbers and causes of most of the accidents on Americas roads that involve a semi truck. 75% of all truck involved accidents on American roadways is due to the driver of the class C vehicle. The exploitation of our nation's Amendment's as well as the Truck Drivers is a disgrace to what we as the backbone of America Sacrifice to make sure the grocery shelves are stocked with food. We ask only to stop being regulated so heavily. We need to look at America's Class C drivers as well. There is no penalties for them when they are involved in the same amount or possibly more accidents then the Professional Drivers. I believe that the Class C Drivers should also much like the Class A commercial Drivers have to take a limited hour class on the dangersdriving conditionsweather conditionsEtc. Etc. The general public needs a class to aquire their license so they may gain awareness of the hazards and dangers of America's roads with a safety course as well to make sure they understand it's importantance of being aware while driving. There is more that can be done to improve the safety of America's roads besides regulating the already over/heavily regulated commercial drivers. I sask you to think about this if you want to improve the ""SAFETY"" of America's roadways DO NOT regulate the hours of commercial drivers with a computer. That is going to do an excessively more amount of damage then it will fixing things. It is not only going to basically force 3.5 million or so American Truck Drivers out of work it is going to effect the roadways themselces. Traffic conditions as well as accidents are honestly going to rise in cities nation wide Because your going to have these drivers on the road all regulated by a computer trying to get through traffic to make an appointment basically forcing them to rush and make mistakes causing more accidents. It is going to force drivers out of the industry as well. You want to regulate Hours Of Service then simply have all your DOT Inspection Stations conduct more logbook inspections. Everyday if every inspection station or weigh station around the country did a mandatory number of logbook inspections everyday there would be less hours of service violations for one for two there would be compliance just as you want. There are other ways to make drivers properly log time as well a run clean hours. Don't out a computer in their trucks because there is heavy talk amongst the trucking community about hanging their keys up and quiting. No one wants to do a job where a computer is telling them what to do all day long. We are truckers because we love the freedom the open road provides us in a way that we do not have to have a boss watching over us all day long. We do not have to work a set schedule. We get to travel and see this beautiful country. There are so many reasons and more we as Americans love what we do despite all we sacrifice to get it done. This Electronic Logging Law takes effect I can promise that there will be a significant loss in jobs for American Truckers. They will quit and not look back. Which will effect the production plants distribution industry. If as many drivers wuit as ar. Estimated then you will have jobs lost everywhere because it will effect everything everywhere. People everywhere will feel the violant sting of loss as the truck drivers who provide their grocery stores food walk away. If we are to be regulated to this extent we might as well not sacrifice our home time our families our lives basically to get it done. We'd rather see our families we'd rather be Home and work a job where we see our kids everyday. This is ridiculous and it's a simple matter of understanding and asking yourself HOW LONG CAN WE PUSH THE TRUCKERS AROUND BEFORE THEY WALK AWAY.?????????","DOT-OST-2017-0057","Review of Policy, Guidance, and Regulations Affecting Transportation Infrastructure Projects","Nonrulemaking","DOT-OST-2017-0057-0012","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2017-06-15T00:00:00-04:00","Theodore Abeelen","Comment from Theodore Abeelen",NA,NA,NA

"24","DOT",FALSE,1,"2017-03-24T23:59:59-04:00","2017-01-23T00:00:00-05:00","I wholeheartedly support the DOT's proposed rule [docket number DOT-OST-2016-0189 Regulatory Identification Number (RIN) 2105-AE58].  Many Americans like myself have had loved ones and family members die on the roadways due to unsafe conditions caused by drug misuse. The DOT rule presently before us is a welcome step forward in transportation safety. Americans individually and corporately enjoy good quality of life when the safety of our roadways and interstate commerce channels is enhanced.First the DOT's proposed rule substituting dual-specimen collection for DNA testing of urine samples is reasonable and would likely withstand legal challenge. A basic aspect of the right to privacy is control by individuals over information about themselves. The Supreme Court has allowed ""special needs"" searches such as random drug tests of railroad employees where the government needs to regulate the conduct of employees for safety purposes. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn. 489 U.S. 602. 619 (1989).Next an amendment to the DOT's drug testing protocol is appropriate and long overdue. The current rules have not been upgraded since 1990. Current research shows that what is apparent to most Americans is true: there is a sizable uptick in prescription opioid abuse in America. According to the CDC the number of opioid-involved deaths and overdose deaths is increasing. In fact they report that six out of 10 drug overdoses are now from opioids.  As more and more trucks and cars share our already-clogged highways system there are safety concerns which need to be addressed. The ability to traverse our highway system safety is integral to our economy and to our American way of life. These sometimes competing interests can both be fostered but only if adequate safeguards are in place. Annually trucks deliver approximately 70 percent of all freight composed of $671 billion in goods within the U.S. and another $590.6 in retail goods between the U.S. and our neighbors Canada and Mexico. Current estimates show that there are at least 15.5 million trucks and 3.5 million truck drivers that use America's national highway system. Of these trucks approximately one in nine are independent owner operators of Class 8 semi-trucks with a gross vehicle weight of over 33000 pounds  In 2015 Americans logged over three million vehicle miles of travel and more than 2.4 million people were injured in vehicle crashes. With increasing highway fatalities despite record high (87%) seat belt use it is clear something else is amiss. The American roadways are only as safe as its drivers. Opioid abuse by drivers is greatly decreasing roadway safety.  The DOT's proposal to add the four Class II opioids to its drug testing panel is reasonable and appropriate given that the use of opioids are increasingly abused and indicated in traffic injuries and fatalities. Drug testing can only work if it is kept current with modern drug usage trends.  The 1990 DOT drug testing procedures initially decreased traffic accidents; however recently traffic accidents and fatalities are on the rise. Drugged drivers were indicated in 11.4 percent of all fatal motor vehicle crashes in 2010 and that prescription drugs accounted for 46.5 percent of the drugs used in fatal crashes with a great increase occurring since the mid-2000s. Given the initial success of the DOT's drug screening program in reducing drugged driving traffic accidents by 10 percent and the recent 7.7 percent increase in automobile fatalities which appeared coincident with the ""opioid epidemic"" the time is ripe for the DOT to amend its drug-testing mechanism to attempt to deal with these realities. Through promulgation of this sound and timely rule the DOT is reasonably and adequately fulfilling its congressional safety mandate. Adding these four Schedule II opioid narcotics to drug testing panel does not add a new layer of DOT regulation. Rather the rule merely brings current DOT's safety screening methods. The 2017 HHS Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs using Urine requires testing for these opioids. This rule also comports with the goals of the NHTSA FHA FMCSA coalition's 2016 ""Road to Zero"" partnership. This rule will not likely result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities since the cost of additional opioid tests will be largely offset by the labs no longer having to store and categorize employees' blind samples. Plus since the labs used already routinely test other federal workers for these four opioids the additional burden is  minimal. Also since the cost of implementing this rule is below the $100 million threshold and will likely save many American lives the benefits of implementing this rule substantially outweigh program costs. In sum this DOT's proposed rule is a timely and well-reasoned upgrade to a safety rule which has lost its effectiveness over time.See attached file(s).","DOT-OST-2016-0189","Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs: Synthetic Opiates and Minor Amendments","Rulemaking","DOT-OST-2016-0189-0034","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2017-03-10T00:00:00-05:00","Lori Carson","Comment from Lori Carson",NA,NA,"2105-AE58"

KalickComment on:Docket No. DOT-OST-2010-0140RIN No. 2105-AD92Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections     Andrew Kalick respectfully contends that DOT's proposed rulemaking addresses long overdue issues. Mr.Kalick feels that tarmac delays and all other matters proposed by DOT and their associated provisions should be included in the contract of carriage. He also approves of the Business Traveler's Coalition comments in their entirety. His comments under this docket number and RIN more urgently address the Choice of Forum and Denied Boarding Rules. Related to these two subject areas Kalick first and foremost believes that DOT lacks authority to regulate (propose rules/enforce current ones) that meddle in individual contractual affairs the ambit of which denied boarding falls (already in the contract of carriage.) Further increasing denied boarding compensation rates is hardly an action that will significantly if at all address the burden increasing involuntary denied boardings impose on passengers. The denied boarding compensation is based on the percentage of remaining flight coupons a fact often ommitted from pundit comments. The airlines simply do not bump lower fare tickets. These lower fare tickets that passengers purchase are often if not exclusively the targets of denied boarding. Not only are they the overwhelming targets airlines bump these passengers with complete disregard for the passengers and with relative impunity. Current and proposed amendments to the regulations at hand are in place and enforced without sole/preemptive authority. Passengers retain the right to pursue actions in state/federal courts in denied boarding/contractual actions. Supreme court precedent is very clear as to this point.

We suggest that each respective FHWA State Division Office be given the authority to approve or disapprove this submission by the state.  Because it will be important for States to receive approval of their plans as quickly as possible in order to implement any changes etc. this approval process should be at the local level in order to allow for quick implementation and correction.  Clarification of 3 year Annual Goal Submission – The proposed rule suggests allowing recipients the ability to provide a year-to-year projection of its likely DBE participation within the framework of a goal and methodology submitted only every three years.  The proposed rule suggests that this flexibility is more relevant for FAA programs because of the likelihood of federal funding fluctuations.  We suggest that the Department allow Recipients to choose one or the other process for benchmarking.  Choosing either a three-year overall goal number with appropriate accountability processes as described in Section 26.47(c) or a year-to-year projection as described here would give the industry a clear understanding of how the State DOT Transit Agency or Airport Authority will be setting their goals.  Changing mid-stream in the process could make reporting very difficult and defeat the purpose of lessening the burden of setting annual goals each year. Personal Net Worth – The proposed rule increasing the PNW cap to $1.3 million explains that this change “does not represent an increase in actual personal worth” because the “inflationary adjustment simply maintains the economic status quo.”  In Colorado and other western states with similar economies and “cost of living” levels an individual with a $1.3 million personal net worth may not necessarily be considered economically disadvantaged.  Unfortunately a “one-size-fits-all” solution will help DBEs in some regions and hurt DBEs in states like Colorado.  Because of the economic downturn Colorado’s DBEs have been hurt severely and are have more difficulty obtaining financing insurance and bonding.  Large construction companies (including larger and stronger DBEs) are bidding on all projects large and small.  Because of their size these larger firms have the ability to under-bid our smaller DBE firms.  This PNW increase will allow financially strong DBEs to remain in the program thus preventing newer and smaller DBEs from growth.The proposed rule should not be an across the board change.  The increased PNW to $1.3 million may be very appropriate for concessions (ACDBEs) since those businesses are capital intensive and have higher cash flow requirements.  Many ACDBEs have to build out their concession space and require bank financing.  In today’s lending environment a lender will require higher asset levels and in fact some are franchises and franchisors often require higher net worths to operate a franchise.  We strongly encourage USDOT to adopt the higher PNW threshold in Part 23 only not in Part 26.  We do not believe a one-size-fits-all standard that suits Part 23 should be applied to Part 26.Some changes that could offset this trend may include proposing a time limit for participation in the DBE program.  An additional change would be to allow states the flexibility to set “tiered” DBE project goals that would allow smaller DBEs to bid against similarly situated companies.  Without implementing changes to other parts of the regulation this PNW increase will penalize small and new DBE firms.The proposal to remove retirement savings from the PNW calculation will in our opinion also benefit the wealthier DBEs and decrease the number of graduations because of personal net worth.  Based on Colorado’s experience family owned businesses (especially those that are woman owned) are more likely to have these types of retirement accounts and use them already to limit their tax liability.  If there is a demographic study done we believe that the majority of individuals that would benefit from this would be non-minority individuals.  One of the arguments in favor of removing retirement savings from the PNW calculation is that they cannot be drawn on.  We disagree with this assertion.  Many can be drawn upon though at a penalty but they can be drawn upon.  In addition they can be borrowed against.  We believe that the consequence of adopting both a higher threshold and removing more assets from consideration means that almost anyone will be considered economically disadvantaged.  In Adarand the Supreme Court found Program eligibility as it was at the time to be both over-inclusive and under-inclusive.  We believe that the proposed adjustments move eligibility back in the direction of being over-inclusive.  By doing so we believe the door will open wider to further Constitutional challenges on the basis that the Program is not narrowly tailored. To monitor potential abuse of this proposal we recommend a requirement that DBEs provide an annual statement identifying changes in their contributions to the accounts during the past year.  A review by certification staff could identify whether individuals and companies were sheltering their assets for the purpose of remaining within the PNW cap.Interstate Certification and Related Issues –NPRM outlines 3 possible approaches:•	Leave things as they are now firms must apply in each state states are allowed the freedom to reach their own conclusions regarding eligibility may enter into their own regional reciprocity agreements;•	Federalize certification central directory;•	Interstate reciprocity•	“Presumptively certified”•	State B must certify within 30 days unless it had good cause to object•	Local appeal must be providedOf the 3 approaches it is the opinion of COUCP that the NPRM favors the one with the least appeal.  COUCP is sympathetic to desire to reduce the burden of firms seeking certification in multiple states.  However that is only one of several concerns and certainly not the most important.  COUCP strongly believes that the paramount concern should always remain the integrity of the Program.  We further believe that of the 3 approaches identified the NPRM favors the one which weakens the Program the most.  Of the 3 approaches COUCP strongly favors leaving the process for certifying out-of-state firms with the individual states.  If the resource problem could be resolved COUCP would be in favor of Federalizing or centralizing the process.  We do not favor interstate reciprocity as proposed.  Our reasoning follows.ProcessThe NPRM acknowledges that there currently exists across the country widely divergent processes interpretations experience and expertise.  The most glaring example of the lack of uniformity of processes can be found in the manner in which on-site interviews are conducted.  Many on-site transcripts we have obtained from home states have little to no practical value in determining a firm’s eligibility.  The Regulation currently requires that all recipients use the same application form and that before a certification decision is rendered an on-site visit be conducted or a transcript obtained from the home state.  COUCP believes that the next logical step before mandating interstate reciprocity is to move toward standardizing the process by first mandating the use of a uniform on-site questionnaire.  Some will counter by saying that circumstances are always different and they don’t want to be bound to a document that may not take into account those differences.  To that we respond that a uniform questionnaire can always be supplemented to fit the circumstances.  Once that has been accomplished the remainder of the process should be standardized. Burden of ProofThe NPRM proposes shifting the burden of proof when processing applications of out-of-state firms from the applicant to the recipient.  At the same time recipients would be required to render decisions within 30 days and would be required to provide the applicant with a local hearing when it proposes to deny certification.  We believe that these proposals have numerous unintended consequences.•	Burden of proof – We believe that the shifting of the burden of proof effectively holds in-state applicants to a higher standard that is inherently unfair to them.  Currently applicant firms must be operational.  One aspect of “operational” is that they have met the legal requirements to do business such as registering with the Secretary of State if a corporation etc. or obtaining the proper license if engaged in an industry (e.g. engineering) requiring one.  If we must go through what amounts to a revocation process for out-of-state firms that have not met the legal requirements to do business we argue that we would be in effect holding in-state applicants to a higher standard.  We strongly disagree with having disparate burdens of proof depending on whether an applicant is in the state or out.•	30 days to render decision – The effect of this requirement is that out-of-state applications will be expedited at the expense of in-state applications.  This is inherently unfair to in-state applicants.•	Local appeal of denial decisions – Places an increased burden on states to disprove a certification granted by another state that may have been flawed in the first place.  Also this requirement appears at odds with USDOT’s stated desire that denials of all new applications be appealed directly to USDOT not appealed locally.Other considerations•	The NPRM references a requirement to enter data into and research a national database prior to rendering certification decisions.  We believe this requirement amounts to an unfunded mandate that it could require a full-time person to implement and that these are resources we simply do not have at the present time.•	If an out-of-state firm is presumptively certified should it not follow that firms who lose their home-state certification be immediately decertified in other states?  If so the administrative burden to continually check the home-state status of out-of-state firms is immense.The NPRM acknowledges the difficulties with this proposal.  We agree with the Department’s observation that moving to nationwide reciprocity at this time is premature.

Pena as well as failing to meet DOT standards for the DBE Program.  To substantiate my reasoning I submit the following information from the DOT OSDBU website specifically from web address: http://osdbu.dot.gov/DBEProgram/sectionbysection.cfm:“Q. Section 26.45 How Do Recipients Set Overall Goals? A.Since its inception the recipient's overall goal has been the heart of the DBE program. Responding to Adarand DOT clarified the theory and purpose of the overall goal in the SNPRM. In the proposed rule the Department made clear that the purpose of the overall goal-- and in fact the DBE program as a whole--is to achieve a ``level playing field'' for DBEs seeking to participate in federal-aid transportation contracting. To reach a level playing field recipients need to examine their programs and their markets and determine the amount of participation they would expect DBEs to achieve in the absence of discrimination and the effects of past discrimination. The focus of the goal section of the SNPRM was to propose ways to measure what a level playing field would look like and to seek input on the availability of data to make such a measurement.”Under “The Proposed Rules and Comments” please refer to paragraph 8:“In view of the complexity and importance of the goal setting process and the many issues raised by commenters the Department has decided to adopt a two step process for goal setting. The process is intended to provide the maximum flexibility for recipients while ensuring that goals are based on the availability of ready willing and able DBEs in each recipient's relevant market. The Department believes that this approach is critical to meeting our constitutional obligation to ensure that the program is narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of discrimination. The first step of the process will be to create a baseline figure for the relative availability of ready willing and able DBEs in each recipient's market. The second step will be to make adjustments from the base figure relying on an examination of additional evidence past experience local expertise and anticipated changes in DOT-assisted contracting over the coming year.”Under “Step 1: Determining a Base Figure for the Overall Goal “ please refer to paragraphs 1 2 3 & 15:Paragraph 1: “The base figure is intended to be a measurement of the current percentage of ready willing and able businesses that are DBEs. Ensuring that this figure is based on demonstrable evidence of each recipient's relevant market conditions will help to ensure that the program remains narrowly tailored. To be explicit recipients cannot simply use the 10 percent national goal their goal from the previous year or their DBE participation level from the previous year as their base figure. Instead all recipients must take an actual measurement of their marketplace using the best evidence they have available and derive a base figure that is as fair and accurate a representation as possible of the percentage of available businesses that are DBEs.”Paragraph 2: “…In this final rule the Department is placing primary emphasis on the principles underlying the measurement mandating only that a measurement of the relative availability of DBEs be made on the basis of demonstrable evidence of relevant market conditions rather than requiring that any particular procedure or formula be used…”Paragraph 3: ”… By fixing only the basic principle but allowing the methodology to change recipients will have the opportunity to fine tune the process each year as their experience grows and the data available to them improve. Finally the rule makes sure that every recipient will have at least one reasonable and practical goal setting method available to them.”Paragraph 15: ”… the methodology must be based on demonstrable data of relevant market conditions and be designed to reach a goal that the recipient would expect DBEs to achieve in the absence of discrimination.”Under “Additional Goal Setting Issues” please refer to paragraph 1:Paragraph 1: “The Department proposed in both the 1992 NPRM and the 1997 SNPRM that overall goals be calculated as a percentage of DOT funds a recipient expects to expend in DOT-assisted contracts…”By going to an every three-year overall goal submission for Part 26 recipients we would be failing to achieve the originally stated two objectives and the published directives.  AIP (Airport Improvement Program) projects vary significantly from year to year in regard to construction work items as well as dollars available for projects.  For example one year you might be determining the DBE goal for a $1.0 million asphalt overlay project and the next year a $2.1 million lighting project.  NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) codes for these two projects vary greatly and significantly affect goal determination.  For clarification NAICS codes are used to determine the work items for the AIP project and from this list we derive the DBEs potentially available to perform the work.As referenced in “Tips for Goal-Setting in the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program” located on FAA Office of Civil Rights website as well as the DOT OSDBU website: “STEP ONE:  The most important thing to remember about step one of the goal setting process is that you are attempting to come up with a measurement of the actual relative availability of DBEs to perform the types of contracts (both prime and sub) that you intend to let.”  The types of projects and the availability of ready willing and able DBEs will most definitely vary from year to year.  Therefore an every three-year goal submission does not “level the playing field” and does not ensure a “narrowly tailored” program.Regarding “whether to provide for annual reviews of goals or adjustments for new opportunities” for AIP projects that change from year to year this is a must.  An annual review ultimately defeats the purpose of the every three-year goal submission because a review requires proceeding through the entire goal-setting process and results in the new submittal of an overall goal.  In a nutshell the same amount of work is required for an annual review or an overall goal submission in order to “level the playing field” and to “narrowly tailor” the program.  An annual review ultimately is a NEW OVERALL GOAL SUBMISSION.The every three-year goal submission probably works well for ACDBE 49 CFR Part 23 where NAICS codes are generally the same from year to year.  However for 49 CFR Part 26 where the NAICS codes change significantly from year to year the every three-year goal submission would not work well and ultimately defeats the purpose of the two main objectives of the DBE Program as well as the directives issued on the OSDBU website.","DOT-OST-2009-0081","Disadvantaged Business Enterprise; Overall Goal Schedule and Substitution","Rulemaking","DOT-OST-2009-0081-0005","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2009-05-19T00:00:00-04:00","Anita Dougherty","Anita Dougherty ","Attachment Contents : ...failing to achieve these two objectives which are based on the <> </> decision regarding Adarand Constructors v.

The 9th Biennial DSA Conference took place in Orlando Florida April 9-15 2007. The local host the Palm Beach County Association of the Deaf (PBCAD) did a tremendous job to make this conference happen. It is amazing what volunteers can do if they are passionate about something. The goal was to have a wonderful one week meeting for deaf seniors and turn it into an unforgettable event.  Kerstin Fox is presenting the donation Donation Poster Indeed the PBCAD achieved this goal by offering very informative work shops lively entertainment interesting tours in Orlando and many social meetings. Our agency in cooperation with Royal Caribbean International had the pleasure of donating a 7-night Eastern Caribbean cruise for two on the brand new Liberty of the Seas. The Liberty will have her maiden voyage in May 2007. The cruise was auctioned off during the live auction during the night show the last day of the conference.

Foreign-flagged cruise ships would only be covered when the ship picks up or discharges passengers at US ports its possessions territories or commonwealths. Foreign-flagged cruise ships would NOT be covered by those rules if the cruise does NOT pick up or discharge passengers in a US port like on a cruise in Europe or Asia.

Kerstin FoxSIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER SERVICE FOR CRUISES As a travel agent with Hibiscus Travel I attended CLIAs (Cruise Lines International Association)cruise 3sixty in Ft. Lauderdale Florida last week. Events like cruise 3sixt are always a great chancefor travel agents to talk to the cruise lines CEOs. Since I specialize in cruises for the deaf traveler I am well aware of the sign language interpreter problem. The ADA (Americans with Disability Act) a law that is effective in U.S. territories including U.S. waters requires that hearing impaired clients have an equal opportunity to enjoy the goods services accommodations and amenitiesoffered by places of public accommodation like a cruise ship. Furthermore effective means of communications like sign language interpreters are necessary to ensure an effective communication with deaf clients. Activities on board of the ships shows or shore excursions can not be communicated by written materialsor exchanging notes since it is not considered an effective communication for this type of entertainment.Certain cruise lines do a wonderful job providing sign language interpreter services on their cruises if requested whether the ship is sailing in U.S. waters or abroad. They provide the service for groups and single traveling passengers alike. It is a good example that providing sign language interpreter service does not cause an undue financial or administrative burden for a cruise line. Deaf clients need sign language interpreter service to equally enjoy a cruise. It is hard to understand why a service that is required by law in U.S. territories including U.S. waters is not being provided. Also to my knowledge no other minority would be denied a service that is guaranteed by law within the U.S. when those passengers go on a cruise sailing abroad. Why is it then that the deaf clients are denied interpreter service on cruises abroad?I felt obligated to address this problem with some of the cruise line CEOs present at cruise 3sixty. I asked them to establish a policy in their company that guarantees sign language interpreter service for deaf clients traveling as individuals or in groups to U.S. destinations or abroad if requested by a travel agent or the individual client. I talked to Micky Arison CEO of Carnival Corp. (member cruise lines are cruise lines like Princess Cruises Carnival Cruise Lines Costa Cruises Holland America and Cunard Line) and to Colin Veitch CEO of Norwegian Cruise Lines. Both gentlemen ask me to submit my request for sign language interpreter service in writing via e-mail. Mr. Arison explained that he will forward my request to all member cruise lines of the Carnival Corp. My request via e-mail went out to Mr. Arison and Mr. Veitch on October 4 2005.

WCCTA operates 41 fully accessible fixed route buses and 13 paratransit vans in a largely suburban area just north of Oakland California.  Our service area is approximately 37 square miles and we have a population of 65000.  Our adopted FY06-07 operating budget for WCCTA is $7.8 Million.  Of this $1.3 Million (approximately 17%) is budgeted for paratransit services including those required under the ADA.  We have taken great pains to ensure we have no denials of service on our ADA paratransit system and on many occasions we have in effect practiced reasonable modifications in our delivery of services to our ADA eligible passengers on both our fixed route and paratransit systems.  We are very proud of our record of ADA compliance and the provision of related services at WCCTA over the past 15 years.WCCTA has very strong concerns with the proposed amendments to 49 CFR parts 27 37 and 38.  While we support the concept of full accessibility of public transit and now provide services beyond those required under the ADA to persons with disabilities we disagree with both the proposed approach and with the specific details of the regulatory changes contained in the referenced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NPRM.  We strongly disagree with the representations in the NPRM that the proposed changes are simply a clarification of existing law and that the proposal does not represent a significant departure from existing regulations and policy and does not have noteworthy cost impacts.  In fact we believe the proposed regulatory changes exceed the scope of the powers delegated to the Department of Transportation in the ADA statute and are in conflict with the both the legislative intent of the ADA and established case law since its passage.  More importantly while we believe the Departments motivation in proposing the amendments is well intentioned we are convinced that actual implementation of the changes will have serious unintended consequences that will diminish the quality safety and predictability of ADA services for our riders while significantly increasing costs.  WCCTA is a signatory to the letter submitted to the Docket by a coalition of public transportation entities agencies throughout the United States.  Rather than attempting to reiterate here the positions presented in that letter (with which we fully concur) we are including the full text of the coalitions comments as an attachment.  We will use the remainder of this letter to provide supplementary comments on issue areas in the NPRM not specifically addressed in the Coalitions letter or where we have additional concerns beyond those included with the Coalition comments.   I.	Reasonable Accommodation The initial passage of the ADA and its implementing regulations established the legal obligation for each public transit agency to develop and submit to the FTA detailed plans for ensuring that persons with disabilities had the same right to public transportation as the general public.  FTAs review and approval of these plans provided an understandable and objective measure of the adequacy of each agencys program in meeting the non-discrimination provisions of the law.  For more than 15 years the FTA-approved plans provided a reasonable and straightforward means of adjudicating and resolving cases alleging civil rights violations.   The de-facto expansion of the standard for ADA compliance (as proposed within the NPRM) based on conditions that will be defined by rider request on a trip-by-trip basis vastly increases public transit operators exposure to litigation and creates an untenable situation where operators will regularly face tough decisions requiring them to compromise passenger safety to avoid a the civil rights violation.  In the NPRM discussion of Reasonable Accommodation it is proposed that a public transit operator upon request from a disabled passenger may be required to pick up or drop off that individual at a location other than an established bus stop.  In California this requirement would place the transit agency in direct conflict with a State Supreme Court decision (Bonanno v. CCCTA) that imposed an expanded duty of care on public transit agencies (indeed on all public entities) to make sure that a route traveled to its property (in the Bonanno case a bus stop served but not owned or controlled by the transit agency) is safe independent of any dangerous condition at the stop location itself.  In the Bonanno decision CCCTA was held liable for $1.5 Million in damages and the basis for this judgment was that the plaintiffs injuries were caused by a dangerous condition she experienced as she tried to access the transit systems services.  To comply with the expanded scope of California public transit operators duty of care and to establish boundaries for the attendant liability for any damages sustained by passengers en-route to public transit services transit agencies must formally evaluate bus stop locations consider any known incidents or public safety concerns for each location and have on record formal approval of each bus stop location by the agencys policy board. It is simply unworkable for a bus operator to be placed in the situation of having to evaluate and make an ad-hoc decision on a request from a passenger to be dropped off at a location that has not undergone the formal risk assessment outlined above.  The operator may be totally unaware of known hazards or unsafe conditions at the location.  Needless to say the overriding consideration here has to be the safety of those using our systems. The changes outlined in the NPRM tend to prioritize individual convenience over safety and in the process put our passengers at risk.  We urge the Department of Transportation to rescind these provisions in their entirety.II.	Trip CountingWCCTA objects to DOTs approach for counting denied trips which DOT currently follows.  DOT counts each leg of a trip as denied even if the transit authority can accommodate the passengers request on one or more leg if the authority cannot accommodate each leg of the trip.  This interpretation is contrary to the scope and intent of the ADA.  The ADA requires that disabled passengers have access to comparable public transportation as able-bodied persons.  As the original regulations state the ADA is not intended to be a comprehensive system of transportation for individuals with disabilities or to meet all of their transportation needs.  Fixed route transportation does not always meet the needs of an individual passenger for every leg of a trip.  For example a passenger may have to leave his house early in the morning for an appointment so as to make it impractical for a passenger to take public transit on one leg of a trip.  The passenger may take a taxi to his appointment and then take public transportation home.  Likewise if a disabled person requests a pick up and the transit agency cannot accommodate the passenger within the required one hour window but the transit agency can accommodate the return trip DOT should consider the transit authority as denying one leg of the trip and not two.  It is not reasonable to penalize a transit agency for providing transportation for one leg of the journey.  Instead DOT should judge capacity constraint based on actual denials of a leg of a trip.  This is the only reasonable interpretation under the ADA.III.	Comment on Other Issues.  Subsection 6 Mobility DevicesThe original ADA regulations provided general guidance to public transit operators and to the manufacturers of mobility devices on the maximum dimensions and weight of devices that would routinely be accommodated aboard public transit vehicles.  These regulations offered minimal assistance in the development and deployment of safe and reliable securement systems for common mobility aids and effectively mandated that public transit systems accommodate any device that did not exceed the maximum physical dimensions and weight defined by the regulation. Over the past 15 years public transit agencies have done their best to safely accommodate a wide variety of mobility devices including three-wheeled scooters despite the fact that manufacturers have paid virtually no attention to equipping these devices with hardware to allow them to be secured in a dynamic environment of a moving vehicle.  The recent guidance DOT provided on Segway devices illustrates the problem we have with the fact that there is still no standard interface between tiedown systems and the mobility devices themselves.  Under the DOT guidance a passenger could right now be boarding one of our vehicles with a Segway (or conceivably a similar Segway-like device from a different manufacturer) and our driver may be figuring out how to try to secure this device despite the fact that not one of our drivers has ever dealt with a Segway before.  The device has a higher center of gravity than many more common wheelchairs and may need to be secured in a completely different way than a standard four point tiedown to prevent it from tipping or moving during vehicle cornering.  A driver encountering the device for the first time will not know if likely anchor points on the Segway will withstand the g-force stresses which may be generated during the trip.  While the driver will make a best guess about whether the device is safely secured there is no assurance that this is in fact true.  We believe that the users of our systems would be better served by the DOT exercising its regulatory authority to promulgate a common standard for securement and to establish a certification process for manufacturers of mobility devices.  Public transit agencies would be only have a legal mandate to transport devices certified to this standard.  This would ensure the safety of the passengers using the devices as well as other passengers transported aboard our vehicles.We appreciate your considering our comments.SincerelyCharles AndersonGeneral ManagerWestern Contra Costa Transit Authority601 Walter AvenuePinole CA  94564(510) 724-3331charlie@westcat.org 									ATTACHMENT 1								Coalition Letter to the Docket 			April 26 2006Docket Management FacilityU.S. Department of Transportation400 Seventh Street S.W.Nassif Building PL-401Washington DC 200590-0001Re:	NPRM:  Docket No. OST-2006-23985 RIN 2105-AD54	49 C.F.R. Parts 27 37 and 38 71 FR No. 38 9761 et seq.  (Feb. 27 2006)	Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities	Dear Docket Clerk:We are a coalition of public transit agencies that provide accessible fixed route transportation and paratransit pursuant to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). We submit these comments in response to the referenced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).  The NPRM proposes to further expand ADA obligations on public transportation providers through amendments to the regulations which implement the ADA currently codified at 49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and Part 38 and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act currently codified at 49 C.F.R. Part 27.  These comments are addressed to the proposals to add a reasonable modification requirement to Title II Subtitle B of ADA (Title II.B.) particularly with respect to paratransit service to add a direct threat definition and exception to the proposed reasonable modification rule and to establish a Disability Law Coordinating Council through a formal rule.  We have joined together in submitting these comments because we are convinced that this NPRMs proposals if adopted will have a significant adverse impact on our agencies transportation services.   We also support the comments prepared by the American Public Transportation Association of which we are members.  Many of us intend to submit separate comments addressing additional issues relevant to our particular circumstances.We support the concept of accessibility of public transit and voluntarily modify our practices and procedures when it is safe and practical to do so. However we oppose the NPRM's ""reasonable modification"" rule because it would impose a legal obligation to modify service on passenger demand without regard to passenger safety potential costs effects on reliability operational and administrative complexities and local community needs.  The reasonable modification rule if adopted as proposed would produce severe adverse impacts on our fixed route transit and paratransit systems is not redeemed by a proposed direct threat exception and its promulgation would exceed the scope of the powers delegated to the Department of Transportation (DOT) in the ADA statute.             DOT does not explain the purpose of its rulemaking proposal relating to the Disability Law Coordinating Council (DLCC). Further establishment of such a Council is a wholly internal administrative process that is not subject to the Administrative Procedures Acts rulemaking requirements. Our concern is that the Council not be used to insulate decision makers from the industry they regulate or the constituent agencies of the DOT from the Administrative Procedures Act and SAFETEA-LU obligations when issuing binding obligation pronouncements.           We urge DOT to rescind these proposals in their entirety.A.   THE COALITION The coalition submitting this comment consists of ___ transit agencies identified in the Appendix to these comments.  Together we deliver more than ___ fixed route and more than ___ paratransit rides per year and expend a combined amount of $_______ in doing so. B.  COMPLEMENTARY ADA PARATRANSIT AND ITS COSTSThe purpose of Title II.B of the ADA (Public Transportation Provided by Public Entities) was to assure that persons with disabilities would have the same right to public transportation as the general public.  The principal means the statute adopted of assuring transportation access for the disabled was to require that public entities make their fixed route systems accessible to persons with disabilities. For those individuals with disabilities who are prevented from using accessible fixed route transportation public entities were required to create and maintain paratransit at service levels comparable (or in the case of response time comparable to the extent practicable) to the transit operators fixed route system (42 U.S.C.12143 (a)). As DOT noted in the Preamble to its ADA regulations when issued in 1991 (56 FR 45584 45601):The ADA is a civil rights statute not a transportation or social service program statute. .Under the ADA complementary paratransit is not intended to be a comprehensive system of transportation for individuals with disabilities.  The Secretary of Transportation explained that it was DOTs intent in adopting the regulations to exercise its discretion conservatively to minimize the addition of costs to public and private entities beyond what the statute itself imposes( 56 FR 45620). Despite the Secretarys conservative intent in developing the initial ADA transportation regulations (49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and 38) the annual cost of complementary ADA paratransit in the United States now exceeds $1.9 billion dollars   - a number many times more than the official estimates made at the time the regulations were adopted. This is due to two factors: first the inherent differences in paratransit and fixed route make paratransit preferable to more disabled riders than had been anticipated by federal estimates (and claims by disability advocates).  Experience shows that many persons with disabilities given a choice (i.e. able to ride accessible fixed route transit) will elect to ride complementary ADA paratransit despite the fact that it can cost the rider up to four times as much to do so.   Many agencies even offer riders free fare not only for the disabled passenger but also for his or her personal care attendant as an incentive to use fixed route service. Yet any positive effects of those policies in terms of reduced paratransit demand have been negligible at best. The second is that the studies on which the original government estimates were based assumed a substantial denial rate. However beginning in 1998 DOT through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) began to interpret the ADA as requiring a zero denial rate.The ADA emphasized the obligation to make fixed route transit accessible to persons with disabilities as the primary method of achieving its accessible transportation goals not only as a means to give persons with disabilities the most independence in travel and the most integrated mode of transportation but also to promote the most efficient means of achieving the access goal. Public transit in general is a highly subsidized system utilizing some combination of local state and federal funding.  The fare revenue does not cover the actual cost of the ride and the difference is funded by taxpayer dollars.  However on fixed route transit (bus and non-commuter rail) the fare subsidy is far less.  For example a 10-mile bus ride might cost $2.00 of which the rider pays $1.25 for a subsidized cost of $.75 a 38% subsidy. Moreover as ridership on the bus system increases the amount of subsidy needed all other things being equal diminishes.  In comparison paratransit utilizing ADA-required service parameters is a highly inefficient means of public transit.  The same 10-mile ride on paratransit will cost $30.00. The rider cannot be charged more than $2.50 thus requiring a subsidy of $27.50 or a 92% subsidy that must be provided by taxpayers.  Thus for the same ride the subsidy for paratransit is more than 36 times that of the bus ride. In addition increased paratransit ridership does not diminish costs per trip but in many circumstances will increase it.  C.	PROPOSED REGULATION:  REASONABLE MODIFICATION OF POLICIES PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES 	 DOT proposes to amend its ADA and 504 regulations to impose a requirement of reasonable modification of policies practices and procedures on public transportation under Title II B. It asserts that this is a mere clarification of existing law and that it is supported by prior regulatory interpretations and case law.  It contends that for this reason the proposal does not represent a significant departure from existing regulations and policy and is not expected to have noteworthy cost impacts.  All of these contentions are unsupportable.  If  DOT intends to pursue this proposal it must comply with the significant rulemaking requirements of Executive Order 12866 and its own Regulatory Policies and Procedures applicable to significant rulemakings as well as with Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) requiring consultation with state and local governments.  We demonstrate below that this proposed regulation is contrary to existing case law and 15 years of operating experience. Neither DOT nor FTA had prior to last year indicated that transit properties had any transportation obligations beyond those incorporated in the regulations and for paratransit what was incorporated in their FTA-approved paratransit plans.  If adopted this regulation will have a powerful negative impact on the already-low productivity rate of this inefficient means of public transportation and significantly increase the cost of meeting ADA regulations.  Moreover as we also show it is beyond the statutory mandate and therefore if adopted would exceed DOTs authority to promulgate ADA regulations.  1.    Analysis of the Reasonable Modification Rule and Title IIShows that the Proposed Rule is Outside the Scope of Title II.B. Title II.A precludes public entities from discriminating against persons with disabilities by excluding them by reason of such disability from participating in public services. 42 U.S.C.§12132. Regulations by the Department of Justice (DOJ) (28 C.F.R. Part 35) flesh out what discrimination means in the context of general public services provided by a public entity.  Historically government programs and activities intended for the general public had been designed without regard to whether those programs and activities were accessible to disabled persons.  DOJ regulations therefore necessarily established a reasonable modification requirement because there are such a wide variety of general public services that developing specific non-discrimination regulations with respect to each of them would be impossible.  However DOJ regulations 28 CFR 35.102(b) specifically exempt public transit because it is the one public service singled out for specific statutory treatment in Title II.B (42 U.S.C. §12141 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOT at 49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and 38. DOT regulations as originally promulgated did not have a reasonable modification requirement for public entities and logically so. Public transit is the only public service specifically and separately addressed by the ADA (under Title II.B). The goal of Title II.B is to assure equal access to public transit by persons with disabilities.  For those who cannot ride an agencys accessible fixed route service complementary ADA paratransit comparable to it is required to be offered..  The eligibility design and the comparable operating parameters for paratransit are specified in the original and detailed DOT regulations.  Fixed route operators designed their paratransit systems accordingly and as required by the ADA statute and the DOT regulations submitted a plan as to how this specialized service would be provided (42 U.S.C.§12143(c)(7)).  FTA approved the plan when ...viewed in its entirety it provides for service comparable to the entitys fixed route service and is therefore compliant with the antidiscrimination provisions of 42 U.S.C. §12143 (49 C.F.R. 37.147(d)).The Departments proposed rule would superimpose on the modifications of the fixed route system imposed by Title II.B including complementary ADA paratransit a requirement to further modify in response to rider demand on a case-by-case basis. We believe that this proposal is unnecessary unworkable and contrary to the intent of the ADA.	2.	The Proposed Rule Is Not A Clarification Of an Existing Rule. There are no reasonable modification requirements in the original DOT regulations. Further DOJ regulations that do have such a provision are inapplicable to public transportation (28 CFR 35.102(b)). The only appellate court to directly address the issue determined that reasonable modification was not required for activities covered under Title II.B. Melton v. Dart 391 F.3d 669 (5th Cir. 2004); cert. denied 125 S.Ct. 2273 (2005).  Melton involved a plaintiff who sought to compel the paratransit agency to modify its curb-to-curb policy and pick up the plaintiff in an alleyway as opposed to the curb in front of his house. The court determined that the concept of reasonable modification did not apply to paratransit: Because paratransit service is meant to act as the disability complement to established fixed route transportation services this comprehensive regulatory scheme signals that no interim extra-plan modification is statutorily or otherwise required by a public entity when the public entity is properly operating under a FTA-approved plan. The FTA-approved plan is itself the accommodation to the disabled by the public transportation entity. It is the violation of the plan itself that constitutes the prohibited discrimination under title II not the failure to modify the plan to address particularized complaints (391 F.3d at 675).In Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania et. al. v. National Passenger Railroad Corporation (Amtrak) WL 1459338 (E.D.Pa. 2005) 16 A.D. Cases 1596 the setting was fixed route transportation and the court persuaded by the reasoning in Melton determined that reasonable modification was not required for matters covered under Title II.B.  DOTs assertion that Burkhart v. Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority 112 F.3d 1207 (1997) appeared to share the Departments assumption about the relationship between the DOT and the DOJ requirements (71 Fed. Reg. 9762) is misplaced. As pointed out in Melton the Burkhart court did not decide whether or not the transit authority was exempt from the DOJ regulations on reasonable modification because that issue had not been raised in the court below (Melton at  674 n.6; Burkhart 112 F.3d at 1210 n. 1).For more than 15 years prior to the issuance in September of 2005 of its unusual guidance regarding origin-to-destination paratransit service DOTs own actions demonstrated that reasonable modification was not a concept applicable to Title II.B.  Since FTA approved our paratransit plans none of which contained a policy to provide modifications of service on rider request there has been no indication that anything beyond complying with the paratransit service criteria was required. Nor can DOT bolster its argument that reasonable modification is a mere clarification of and existing rule by pointing to  its own unprecedented act of issuing in 2005 its first written guidance on paratransit (interpreting the origin-to-destination requirement) and issued  after this NPRM was drafted.  In that interpretation DOT for the first time contended that the origin-to-destination language of the regulations meant that the transit operator had to reasonably modify its service model of curb-to-curb service on request of any rider.  Such an interpretation is contradicted by years of contrary interpretation by FTA officials relied upon by transit agencies.  For example on June 14 2003 at the Community Transportation Association of America annual conference in Seattle Michael Winter Chief of FTAs Office of Civil Rights sought to persuade transit operators to address mobility needs of the disabled by providing service beyond that required by ADA. He conceded that the paratransit regulations require no better than curb-to-curb service and that whether to go beyond that and provide door-to-door service for ADA eligible riders is left to local decision-making processes.   This was consistent with other FTA written pronouncements indicating that the origin-to-destination language of 49 C.F.R. §37.129 means that [t]he exact location of pick-up and drop-off sites are an operational issue not governed by the regulations.   DOTs view of the requirements of §504 of the Rehabilitation Act has changed as well.. Before the ADA was passed the author of the current NPRM expressly stated that special accommodations (the equivalent of reasonable modification) for persons with mental visual or hearing impairments were not required under 504 as interpreted by DOT regulations and concluded that to impose such a requirement would require an amendment to the regulations (52 FR 30803 (DOT Docket 45162) (1987)).  We are unaware of any such amendment ever being made.  3.     The Proposed Rule is Unnecessary.   Specific regulations already establish requirements for accessible fixed route and paratransit service (49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and 38). These regulations provide the accommodation or reasonable modification of the fixed route transportation (a general public service) for persons with disabilities and have been the basis for the design and operation of accessible fixed route and paratransit systems for more than 15 years.  On a practical level the rule is unnecessary because transit agencies do make best efforts to provide modifications requested by their riders.   It is essential however for the good and safety of all of the passengers (as well as to contain the costs of this service which was intended to be a limited service for a limited group of people) that these decisions remain within the discretion of the accountable parties the transit operators.  There are no data in the NPRM to indicate that there is a problem needing correction. A few complaints or lawsuits given the number of paratransit trips given each year(83000000 in 2004 ) and the billions of bus and subway rides annually suggests overwhelmingly that riders needs in this regard are being met.  Under these circumstances it is inexplicable why the DOT would promulgate a regulation on this subject at all and especially one that imposes a burdensome administrative process not only to make each such determination but also to document compliance.    4.  The Proposed Rule is Improper. The ADA at 42 U.S.C. §12143(c) (3) authorizes DOT to set forth the levels of service necessary for ADA paratransit systems to be deemed comparable to the applicable fixed route and therefore nondiscriminatory.  Similarly the ADA at 42 U.S.C. §§12142 12147 and 12148 specify the requirements for accessible fixed route transportation vehicles and facilities.  DOTs proposal to superimpose on these requirements a condition that will be defined only by rider request on a trip-by-trip basis exceeds its statutory authority because it fails to define or otherwise exceeds what is comparable to the applicable fixed route.  The proposed regulation also is procedurally improper because as previously stated the DOT has not complied with the conditions imposed by Executive Orders 12866 and 13132. 5.	As to Complementary ADA Paratransit the Proposed Rule Makes No Sense. Complementary ADA paratransit is not a service for the general public that needs to be adapted or modified to meet the special needs of persons with disabilities. It is designed from the ground up as a modification of and alternative to fixed route service to accommodate a subset of persons with disabilities who cannot use accessible fixed route service. There is no rationale for superimposing on the specific regulations regarding eligibility design and operations of a compliant system the obligation to customize each ride upon request.	There is no discussion in the NPRM of what consideration if any was given to the effect on paratransit riders if the service were no longer to be clearly defined by regulations that are universally applicable and consistent.  Currently wherever the rider may be when traveling around the country or even if living in one paratransit jurisdiction while working in another and using both systems on a regular basis the rider knows what the service must provide.  By going to a modification-by-demand standard DOT will force transit agencies to change aspects of service across-the-board when enough riders request the same or similar modification because the rule as proposed leaves the agencies with no clear basis for denying specific types of requests. This is so because the logistics involved in responding on a person-by-person day-to-day basis as suggested by DOT would have an adverse impact on service reliability as explained below at C.6 and could add even greater costs and productivity losses than by changing the service across-the-board.  However this means that in any given jurisdiction paratransit service is going to mean something different.  When riders need to use more than one paratransit system (not unusual for those working or attending school in metropolitan areas but living in suburban areas or the reverse) they will not have the certainty of knowing what to expect with regard to each of the service parameters set out in 49 CFR §37.131.  Moreover if agencies change the service to attempt to contain the exorbitant costs of this proposed mandate they will simply have set themselves up for demands by some riders to change the system back to the way it was on a case-by-case basis to meet their asserted needs.  ADA mandated accessible mass transit and mass paratransit albeit in a necessarily modified way for the disabled.  DOT by expanding service requirements enunciated in the original regulations through its 2005 formal interpretations and this proposed rule will effectively mandate individualized transportation service for each disabled person.  .   If such a radical departure from ADAs intent is necessary and appropriate it clearly requires legislative not regulatory action.	6.  The Proposed Rule Will Add Substantial Uncertainty Operational Complexity Costs and Decreased Reliability.If a transit agency must modify each trip as requested to do so by the rider it is easy to envision a service in which many or most trips are customized. It is not possible to predict all of the circumstances in which modifications might be sought and therefore accurately forecast its total potential cost. However DOTs positions on at least three such instances are either discussed in the NPRM or in other Department pronouncements. These are door-to-door paratransit service (71 FR 9763) allowing wheelchair users to ride sideways (November 8 2005 FTA Letter to Santa Cruz MTD) and the case-by-case abandonment of designated bus stops on fixed route service (71 FR 9764).  In suggesting that these examples are reasonable modifications DOT makes it clear that it does not consider them to be fundamental alterations of service.  We disagree.  (a) Modification of Paratransit Service.    The safety and productivity costs of on-demand door-to-door service are well known by transit agencies. For those systems currently using a curb-to-curb service model these costs include increased dwell time risk to other passengers and the vehicle when left unattended and decreased system capacity because of lower efficiency resulting in increased operating costs and the necessity of renegotiating many millions of dollars in third party provider contracts.  Dwell time is increased because the driver is helping the rider to the door and returning to the vehicle.  Assuming that an additional four minutes is needed at each end of the trip (pick-up and drop-off) to provide door-to-door service and that one-half of all rides will eventually request door-to-door service we estimate that paratransit variable costs will increase by 10.29% (employee compensation and maintenance running costs would actually increase by more than 10%) and fixed costs would increase by 5.44%.  We estimate that just a single requirement to provide door-to-door service on demand will increase the costs of transit agencies currently providing curb-to-curb by at least 8.18%. Given current predominance of curb-to-curb service models this translates to an estimated nationwide cost in excess of $100000000.    Despite the extraordinary cost that could be incurred nationally (and for each agency that does not currently offer door-to-door service) by just this one service modification the proposed regulation would not stop there but would mandate a host of other customized ride requests each of which have a similar propensity for escalating the cost and reducing the reliability of a paratransit ride while reducing the capacity of the system.  Moreover there is no meaningful procedure through which an agency could verify that any modification requests are in fact compelled by the persons disability rather than mere preferences for convenience (of the individual or his/her family).  The following are examples of other than door-to-door modification requests that this coalitions members have received and except for a very few in which riders may not be able to identify a disability-related need it is readily apparent that a claim can be made that the request is disability-related whether true or not: (1) 	Demands that preclude shared ride or reduce capacity:  ·	Claustrophobia combined with other disabilities·	Desire to transport bulky packages/equipment as part of tools of the trade of the rider·	Service animal allergies and phobias·	Allergies to perfumes other common chemicals·	Refusal to ride with others based on race or gender physical attributes such as odors behavior of others such as use of obscenities racist remarks·	Intermediate stops where driver would be required to wait·	Demand for non-stop ride due to physical debilitation before/after medical treatment (dialysis chemotherapy etc.)·	Ride with wheelchair or scooter facing sideways·	Space for additional mobility aide to be transported with rider using a different mobility aide·	Space for cart carrying six oxygen tanks·	Specific route (smoother roads less bumpy ride) ·	Specified vehicle temperature·	Will not ride with a specific other passenger; must ride with a specific other passenger(2) 	Demands for Specific Equipment or Seating Location: ·	Must have van·	Must have sedan·	Must have front seat of sedan·	Must have specific seating location in van or sedan·	Must have reclining front seat·	Must have unmarked sedan (stigmatized by name of service on vehicle)·	Must have mini-van·	Must have vehicle with less-stiff suspension·	Must have vehicle with no boarding lights or alarms because they cause seizures·	Vehicle too small or enclosed·	Vehicle must be equipped with outside handles to aid sight-impaired but ambulatory rider to board the vehicle·	Combined weight of rider and mobility device exceeds 600 lbs.·	Oversized mobility device	·	Transport rider with fully-reclined wheelchair·	Must have two seats due to size	(3) 	Demands for specific driver or specific gender of driver: ·	Fear of minorities due to racial/ethnic bias of rider·	Fear of molestation ·	Non-smoking driver (even though driver doesnt smoke on bus he/she smells of smoke)·	Drivers with specific second language skills·	Drivers with security clearances for specific pick-ups/drop-offs in security area(4)  	Demands for unsafe travel: ·	Refusal to allow mobility device to be secured·	Refusal of ambulatory passengers to buckle seatbelts or unbuckling them during travel·	Refusal of passenger who uses wheelchair to buckle seat/shoulder harnesses at wheelchair locations·	Unsafe pick-up or drop-off points ·	Drop off at different location than scheduled·	Driver to leave vehicle unattended and out of sight due to rider need for escort to door or through-door ·	Refusal to travel with PCA where individual cannot travel alone requiring extraordinary assistance of driver or resulting in danger to individual driver or other passengers(5)	Demands that exceed paratransit service parameters:   ·	Pick-up or drop-off times to accommodate intermodal transportation connection outside hours of paratransit service·	Cannot arrive not earlier than a certain time outside hours of paratransit service·	Provide final destination transportation where intermodal transportation connection is missed·	Provide at-door pick-up which is outside ¾ mile service corridor·	Rescue trips to pick-up passenger within or outside service hours because persons disability precluded his/her keeping proper track of time and he/she was a no show at scheduled pick-up time·	Driver to wait excessive periods of time with rider because no caregiver is at the location and rider needs PCA but does not travel with one·	On-board requests to drop off guest or PCA at different location than riders scheduled destination·	Paratransit service to provide an escort for a rider·	Drivers to call rider on telephone upon arrival or as approaching arrival·	Failure/refusal to pay full paratransit fare·	Needs more no-show allowances·	Point of service requests:  add guest change destination make intermediate stop wait for return trip etc.·	Day of service request for vehicle with available wheelchair space (or the reverse) that had not been reserved when the trip was reserved (due to changing physical condition weather)·	Pick-up/drop-off at door requires carrying passenger using mobility device up or down steps·	Fixed pick-up or fixed drop-off time(s)·	At point of service passenger arrives with a guest for which no reservation had been made ·	Service available during weekdays but passenger also wants the service on weekends where reduced fixed route service have concomitant reduced paratransit service area·	Real time request for earlier pick-up because less time was needed than planned and passenger cannot wait for scheduled pick-up·	Request that vehicle wait beyond established waiting time for passenger to arrive for pick-up	In short the effects on paratransit of legally compelled ad hoc service modifications would be to create a system far removed from that complementary with and comparable to the fixed route as envisioned by the ADA.  On a practical level to require a system that was never designed or intended to meet all of the transportation needs of disabled persons to customize each ride to meet the riders claimed needs would result in substantial reduction in capacity due to increased inefficiency (i.e. fewer passenger miles per vehicle due to increased dwell times and increase in non-shared rides) thereby substantially increasing both operating and capital costs (b)          Fixed Route Transportation.  It is patently unacceptable to leave   pick up and drop off locations to individual bus operators discretion based on passenger requests when the decision may result in a civil rights violation. Further there is an inherent risk of increased vehicle accidents passenger injuries and deaths together with the degradation of on-time performance.   . In any event any individual with a disability who cannot use accessible fixed route service as it is operated by the transit agency is by statutory definition eligible for paratransit (42 U.S.C. §12143(c)(1)(A)(i)); 49 C.F.R. §37.123.  This alone demonstrates that reasonable modifications are not required by current regulations and cannot be required through new regulations.  The statute clearly leaves to transit agency discretion a decision whether to modify its fixed route service beyond ADA requirements to make it available to a larger class of people with disabilities or to provide those persons with paratransit service.The following are examples of fixed route modification requests that this coalitions members have received and like the requests on paratransit a claim can easily be made that these requests are disability-related:·	Pick-ups/drop-offs at other than designated bus stops·	Specific bus type to be dispatched because of securement type/location·	Specific bus type to be dispatched because of lift/ramp types ride quality or other amenities on the bus.·	Assistance with packages or luggage on boarding·	Operator to push wheelchair·	Operator to assist rider across nearby intersection·	Operator or crew member to take charge of a service animal during boarding or exiting·	Operator or crew member to act as a PCA for the rider who needs one but insists on riding without one.(c)	Administrative Problems.  The Department envisions that the local transit agency will make the individual case-by-case determinations as to whether a request for modification  is related to the riders disability and if so involves a direct threat fundamental alteration or undue burden. If not the request must be granted.  If the request is denied there is the further obligation to seek another means of achieving the goal of the requested modification. All this is further subject to the Departments right of review (71 FR 9762-63).  This time-consuming process cannot work in the real world of mass transit. Most requests will occur at the point of reservation or in the field at the point of travel.  DOTs proposed rule seems to expect public agencies to entrust to their drivers or reservationists the task of making complex decisions that could expose an agency to civil rights violations and tort liability for injuries deaths and vehicle damage.  Because such determinations will under the proposed rule carry potentially significant legal and operational consequences to the transit agency it is unlikely that any agency would entrust such determinations to anyone below an executive level. Accordingly responsible implementation of the proposed rule is operationally impractical.  Assume an average paratransit service that books more than 1000 rides per day and assuming only 10% of those request a service modification an executive of the agency could not possibly have time to consider and rule on the propriety of 100 requests daily or to complete the paperwork to support each denial and devise an alternative as required by the proposed rule.	Finally this proposal is likely to result in unreliable service.   A service that changes daily to meet the specialized needs of that particular days constellation of passengers will decrease the reliability of the service.  It simply cannot be expected that drivers can reliably master and keep track of the different services to be made available to each customer.  Consequently entirely understandable human failures in this regard by the drivers will result in failed pick-ups or longer dwell times and consequent late drop-offs.	7.	The Proposed Direct Threat Exception  Definition Ignores Rider Safety and Will Not in Any Event Ameliorate the Defects in this Proposed RuleDOT proposes to incorporate in Title II.B the same definition of direct threat that exists in Title II.A as a basis (in addition to undue burden and fundamental service alteration) upon which transit agencies can deny a disabled riders service modification request relating to fixed route or paratransit service (71 FR at 9763-64).  However when the service at issue is transportation rather than all of the other types of government services afforded under and in accordance with Title II.A the definition is inappropriate because it does not permit a decision to deny the modification request based on one of the very likely reasons why it should be denied; namely that if granted it would be a danger to the disabled person making the request.  By common law common carriers have an enhanced duty of care to provide safe transportation to their passengers. Nothing in the legislative history of the ADA suggests an intention by Congress to abrogate this duty especially where it involves the safety of persons with disabilities a group the statute seeks to specifically benefit.  Under DOTs proposed approach a transportation agency would be considered to be discriminating against a disabled person by refusing to engage in conduct that was unsafe for that disabled person.  This would certainly be a unique application of civil rights law.  Moreover nondisabled persons do not have a right to demand and receive unsafe transportation for themselves.  It cannot be seriously argued that ADA created such a right for disabled persons.Transportation agencies must continue to provide safe passage for their passengers.  If a disabled person believes that a request has been denied on a pretextual basis then he or she can file a complaint with FTA or litigate directly whether the request was denied for discriminatory reasons rather than on the basis of safety or other non-discriminatory reasons.  This is in keeping with traditional civil rights law; disabled persons do not need a new ADA regulation to press such a claim.  Under DOTs proposal the regulation presumes that a denial of a modification request because it would constitute a direct threat to the safety of the disabled person is discriminatory per se.  A transportation agency should not be forced to intentionally engage in conduct known to it to be unsafe for its passengers or face litigation.  This Hobsons Choice is untenable.  However even if the safety of the requesting rider were included in the definition of direct threat its addition to the  undue burden and fundamental service alteration limitations of the proposed rule could not and will not resolve the fundamental flaws in the reasonable modification proposal which we have brought to DOTs attention in these Comments.D. 	PROPOSED RULE:  DISABILITY LAW COORDINATING COUNCIL The DOT does not explain why it seeks to promulgate by regulation an internal administrative process that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) clearly exempts because it is a rule of agency organization procedure or practice. 5 U.S.C. §553(b)(3)(A). Moreover DOT states that the Council is in place and functioning effectively (71 FR at 9765).  If a regulation were required it would have to have been promulgated in advance of the Council issuing binding guidances thus raising the question whether those issued to date are valid. A stated need to have all of DOTss constituent administrations issue consistent interpretations is an inappropriate goal given that the statutory provisions and regulations for the different transportation modes under the jurisdiction of FRA FTA and FAA are different.  Proper interpretations would reflect those differences not eliminate them.While DOT can continue this process with or without a regulation we do not agree that the Council is functioning effectively with respect to agencies subject to FTA.  To date the Councils actions seem to be focused on overturning all of the settled expectations concerning the ADA which had been based appropriately on guidance provided over all these years by FTA and FTA-approved paratransit plans.  Moreover the process by which prior interpretations are overruled by the Council is poorly designed.  Up to now there has been no attempt to determine if the complaints received by DOT are true; no survey of how widespread the issue may be; no request made for information from public transit in order to fully understand the issue or the potential ramifications of imposing a new guidance; no survey of riders done to determine whether what the complainant seeks is reasonable (and whether if granted would interfere with other riders service quality).  Consequently if the Council is to continue its legitimacy will depend not on how it was established but by the integrity of its process. Council processes should require sufficient and objective fact-finding and comment from all stakeholders before interpretations are issued and the Council should limit its pronouncements to reasonable interpretations of promulgated regulations and not attempt to create new rules without rulemaking (such as the origin-to-destination and Segway guidance issued by the Council in September 2005).  Given no express or apparent necessary basis for the creation of the Council by regulation we are concerned that its establishment by this process not result in circumventing the APA and the recent amendment to §5334 of the Federal Transit Act in §3032(l) of SAFETEA-LU enacted in August 2005.  Section 3032(1) requires that the rulemaking procedures under the APA be followed before any FTA statement or guidance is issued that imposes a binding obligation on transit properties and those similarly situated.  The purpose is to require transparency and obtain input from all effected parties before these determinations are made. The establishment of the Council by regulation should not be used to insulate DOT or FTA from this requirement.  Because the Council already exists and it is apparently unnecessary to validate it by rulemaking the proposed rule should be withdrawn. For 15 years under the ADA the DOT delegated to FTA the duty to monitor compliance by transit properties with Title II B including the approval of paratransit plans conducting capacity assessments engaging in complaint review and providing guidance to transit agencies.  This choice was appropriate as FTA funds many such agencies and has a greater specific experience with respect to the practical aspects of public mass transit delivery. We are concerned that the new regimen of using the interagency Council will by minimizing the role of the FTA in this process result in determinations that are ill conceived or impractical to implement.  E.  	CONCLUSION	The thrust of our comments should not be misunderstood.  They do not address the propriety of modifications made every day by transit agencies as a matter of voluntary customer service which currently take into account available resources safety practicality and service impacts. What is here addressed is the notion that the law should require individualized customized modifications of rides on a public transit system where the law already defines what is required for such a system not to be discriminatory. To superimpose such a requirement would create a system that is not comparable to the service provided to passengers on fixed route transportation and thus is beyond the mandate of the ADA. Imposition of legally compelled modifications will likely result in a public transit system that provides poorer not better service to the vast majority of persons with disabilities.Respectfully submittedMark R.

CCCTA operates 131 fully accessible fixed route buses and 51 paratransit vans in a largely suburban area just east Oakland California. Our services area is over 200 square miles and we have a population of over 500000.  Our draft FY07 operating budget for CCCTA is just under $30 million. Of that $4.6 million is budgeted for ADA paratransit or about 15.3% of our total projected expenditures. In the month of February 2007 we had 1189 individual users of ADA paratransit service. We typical certify up to 100 or more ADA paratransit users each month. We have taken great steps to encourage the use of fixed route services among would be ADA paratransit users by providing travel training working with health care providers and other providers of services to the disabled and by offering free fares on fixed route service for eligible users between the hours of10:00 am and 2:00 pm. We have taken great pains to ensure that we do not deny service on our ADA paratransit service. And on many occasions we have in effect practiced reasonable modifications in our delivery of services to the disabled on both fixed route and paratransit services. We are very proud of our record of ADA compliance and the provision of related services at CCCTA over the past 15 years.  CCCTA has very strong concerns with the proposed amendments to 49 CFR parts 27 37 and 38.  While the proposed amendments seem well intentioned it is our strong belief that these proposals will serve to substantially reduce the reliability and predictability of accessible transportation substantially increase the costs of accessible services and ultimately result in significantly less accessible public transit for both our disabled and other transit riders.  Our specific comments follow.49 CFR Parts 27.7 37.5 and 37.169While the preamble discussion to this proposed amendment is extensive and focuses on the provision of passenger assistance beyond the curb the actual language of the proposed amendment is overwhelmingly general and will impose far more extensive obligations on transit operators and operations than the preamble indicates.  The proposed requirement would require reasonable modification in any and all aspects of public transportation services where an individual makes a claim that they need such modification to effectively make use services.  The major problem with this proposed requirement beyond the extensive costs that it would impose is the introduction of a number of variables in to the delivery of service that will reduce the reliability and predictability of our transit services.  It is important to realize that in order to deliver a quality and consistent service it is necessary to have well defined procedures that our drivers have been trained to proficiency in.  (In fact the current regulations require our operators to be trained to proficiency on issues that affect accessibility). Anytime we increase the complexity and the variability of the delivery of service (by requiring customized passenger responses as the NPRM proposes) we increase the opportunity for our staffs to make mistakes and judgments which can and will result in service failures and a loss of reliability.  Numerous research studies show that increasing the decisions that operators dispatchers and reservations agents have to make on daily basis will serve to substantially reduce the reliability of our services.  When we have surveyed our passengers with disabilities their number one priority over convenience comfort speed and directness is the reliability and consistency of their service. The NPRM also indicates that these proposed modifications to the DOT regulations do not represent significant departures from existing regulations and policy and not expected to have noteworthy cost impacts on regulated parties.  This statement reflects a complete lack of understanding of the impacts and the magnitude of the change that is proposed.  The proposed regulations would require the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the regulated transit providers to document each individual decision to deny a requested modification on the basis that the requested modification creates an undue burden or fundamental alteration of the primary service.  This requirement by itself is highly burdensome.  At CCCTA we receive a large number of requests for modification daily. From information from our operators and dispatchers we estimate that we receive more than 20 requests per day.  This equates modification requests on about 3% of our daily paratransit trips and something less than 0.25% of fixed route trips.  If we are required to document by the CEO each time we deny a modification request on the basis it violates operating policy or is unsafe we will have to add additional staff at a cost of nearly $80000 per year.    Probably the best way to illuminate these potential impacts is to describe a number of actual service modification requests that we have dealt with over the last year within our relatively small system. Illustrative Examples: Fixed Route	Stop Locations:  The NPRM discusses the concept that picking up a person at other than a defined stop location could be reasonable accommodation.  And while on its surface this does seem reasonable experience has shown that it is fraught with serious safety and reliability issues.  Our system has a number of rural routes that have very rural segments where no sidewalks or walking pathways exist. Safety issues will increases dramatically if we are required to stop a bus anywhere along these types of routes without regard to safety. Many of routes are along highly developed suburban type roadways with high speed limits. Many adjacent areas are simply too dangerous to allow any passengers on or off the bus at that given point. Moreover we are now paying even more attention to bus stop safety in response to a State of California Supreme Court Decision Bonanno v. CCCTA where were found at fault and responsible for a victim that was hit by a car while reportedly going to one of our bus stops. The bus stop in questions was placed at an intersection with a cross walk. The victim was in the crosswalk when hit by a car. But the Court found that CCCTA should have known that crossing the road in that crosswalk to get to our bus stop was a dangerous situation and we should have removed the bus stop and not allowed anyone to board or get off a bus at the location of the bus stop. Additionally CCCTA receives complaints that someone was passed at up at a bus stop. In most cases the bus operator states that did not see the person in question. These situations will only increase under the proposed rule as bus operators will not always recognize would be disabled passengers away from the bus stops. If we have passengers being missed on an occasional basis where operators expect passengers one can see that it is highly likely that transit operators will pass up disabled passengers who are attempting to utilize the services from unconventional locations.  CCCTA bus operators cannot be expected to determine the intentions of individuals standing along the side of the road away from bus stops or stop at any location the passengers request.  If we are required to stop at other than defined stops to accommodate disabled persons it will create conflict on the bus between drivers and passengers and will cause numerous disabled passengers to be passed by unintentionally.  This potential will also cause increased radio and dispatch time as operators request clarifications and authority.  The NPRM proposal will require our operators to make off the cuff significant safety and civil rights decisions.  It is bad public policy to put our operators and passengers in this unfair situation.  		Alternative Fare Media:  Periodically we receive requests to provide alternative fare media for disabled riders.  Currently we accept coins paper bills tokens and passes.  We receive fairly regular requests for paper ticket because tokens and coins are difficult for person with certain disabilities to handle.  We have denied the request because we do not want to complicate our fare media and the cost of processing paper tickets is substantially higher than that of tokens.  If we were required to provide alternative fare media it would increase our costs by $25000 per year (printing security and staff time).    		Tie-Down Locations/Orientation:  Several of our older fixed route buses have rear door lifts with one forward and one rear facing tie-down location.  Due to the orientation of the lift and the ambulatory seating it is impossible to put someone in the rear facing location if someone is riding in the forward facing tie-down location.  Further if someone is in the forward facing location the ambulatory passenger aisle is effectively blocked.  Because of this less than ideal arrangement it is practice that wheelchair users be loaded into the rear facing location unless it is already occupied. Several individuals have requested that we only transport them in the forward facing location because they allege that their disabilities are better accommodated forward facing.  While operators will usually honor this request (particularly on our long distance routes where we have very few wheelchair users) on routes with numerous wheelchair users the operator will usually decline so that they can effectively serve all of our passengers. If we were required to provide reasonable modification we would be faced with a situation where we would have to unload one passenger to board the second passenger and then set up a potential conflict between the passengers or have to send a second vehicle so both passengers can travel forward facing.  This is another situation that will increase dispatch and radio time as well as creating on vehicle conflicts and its affiliated costs.   Paratransit Service:	Door to Door Service:  CCCTA provides curb-to-curb ADA paratransit and for a few riders that need it reasonable modifications that resemble door-to-door and go beyond the current ADA regulations. This means that our operators will provide boarding and alighting assistance to riders from the paratransit vehicles to the door of the origin and destinations as long as the door is within the line of sight of the paratransit vehicle and that the driver can maintain control of the vehicle when this is needed to provide service to an individual. The drivers are also instructed to not go through any door (although they can open public doors and announce their presence) and they are not permitted to lift a person or attempt to navigate steps with a passengers wheeled devices.  This service is limited to locations where the operator can safely park a vehicle avoid overhanging obstructions and avoid backing the vehicle up.  In addition we will not serve locations where the pathway to the door has not clear or where the operator has to have a security gate opened.  Additionally we will not provide door to door service to individuals who do not have a phone or access to a phone where we can reach them to let them know that we could not find a safe parking location within the sight of their origin.  Most of service is curb-to-curb without modification. The proposed rule will have the effect of making our entire system door-to-door. It is our strong belief that by introducing variables in the required services (by requiring reasonable modification as proposed) will reduce the reliability of service to point that systems will have to add back-up vehicles and systems at significant cost to ensure ADA compliant levels of service.  Each additional vehicle we add to our service costs us $170000 (about 3.7% of paratransit budget) annually.		Exclusive Trips:  Many passengers on a daily basis make requests for exclusive trips on the basis of need related to their disability.  We have had individuals state that they need exclusive trips because they have phobias that make it impossible to ride with others or that they are so claustrophobic that they can not tolerate being in the vehicle for any length of time and therefore need a faster exclusive ride.  An extreme case we had was with a mentally disabled child who attacked other passengers.  The care giver asked us to provide an exclusive ride accommodation because they maintained that the child was only violent in the presence of other individuals and so if they had exclusive rides they could effectively benefit from the service.  Currently as the accommodation of an exclusive ride is rarely provided in our system most riders do not request it.  Even so our reservations staff reports that they receive this request from different individuals at least twice a week.  If we were to grant this accommodation 100 times a year and the requester rides and average of 24 times per month (12 round trips) we would reduce our system wide productivity by nearly 5%%.  This loss of productivity would cost us approximately $200000 (or about 4.3% of our paratransit budget) a year.   	Reduced Scheduling Window:  A more common request for a disability related accommodation is where an individual claims that they need an exclusive ride because they have a schedule that can not accommodate a shared ride and that schedule is necessitated by their disability.  For example individuals have requested exclusive trips where they report that they have a personal care aide who can arrive no earlier than 7:00 am to assist them and that they require 1 hour to be ready for a pick-up. They also have an appointment with a specialist that they could only get at 9:00 am and the minimum ride time from their home to the specialist is 30 minutes.  Accordingly they request the accommodation of a reduced scheduling window so that the pick-up be between 8:00 am and 8:20 am (rather than the regulatory required 7:00 am to 9:00 am negotiation window) in order to accommodate the schedule of the aide.  Further they will usually also request an exclusive ride so that they can make their appointment on time.  This request is highly common.  Our staff reports that they have this kind of request nearly every day.  The cost of accommodating this type of request would be extreme.  Our estimate is that it would cost us over $400000 (8.9%of paratransit budget) per year to reduce scheduling windows and speed up travel by reducing shared rides.  	Private Streets - Trailer Parks/Large Apartment Blocks:  Many of our riders live in trailer parks or large apartment blocks. Commonly they will live at a significant distance from the public street and will therefore request their paratransit pick-up in front of their trailer or apartment because of mobility limitations.  In some cases this is not much of an issue because the private street serving the park or complex is large enough to accommodate our vehicles.  But even where the private streets are large enough we have issues with parked cars over grow vegetation and other impediments.  Because the streets are private we can not call the police to ticket or tow an obstructing vehicle and we have no assurance that trees and other vegetation is cleared to a height or that awnings overhangs and other impediments will permit our vehicles to access the rider.  The situation becomes even more of a problem where the access street is narrow and or unpaved.  In these circumstances some of our vehicles may be able to access the riders trailer or apartment but usually not all of our fleet.  This creates a huge scheduling complication where we then need to assign a particular sized vehicle to a particular passenger.  Anytime we are required to assign a particular vehicle to a specific passenger we reduce the systems productivity (passengers per hour) and therefore increase costs. This impact is very significant.  In  our system where we have chosen to go beyond the ADA requirements and provide access to many private drives enter into apartment complexs and trailer parks this decision has increased our daily vehicle needs by 10 to 15% or approximately $300000 (6.5% of paratransit budget) annually.  Additionally we have between 2 and 5 accidents every year where we strike an overhang awning or tree where we cause several thousand dollars in damage.  	Oversized Wheelchairs: Currently we do not handle oversized wheelchairs. To do so would require a significant retrofit of our fully ADA compliant fleet. These costs would be tremendous at $70000 per paratransit vehicle and at $300000 per transit bus.  	No Show Forgiveness:  Regularly we receive requests for accommodations from individuals who are facing suspensions for no-shows.  These requests ask that we forgive a no-show because it was earned due to a symptom of a disability.  For example an individual will claim that they no-showed because they needed to unexpectedly use a restroom and this need was disability related.  Or an individual with diabetes will claim that they felt their blood sugar falling and needed to seek food and were unable to make their bus.  Some blind individuals have claimed that they no-showed because they were waiting at the wrong location and did not realize this because of their blindness.  Probably the most significant number of no-show related accommodation requests we receive are from individuals with mental disabilities. Many of these individuals will claim that their no-shows are caused by their disabilities which cause them confusion forgetfulness or other orientation related symptoms which causes the no-shows.  As they claim this is a feature of their disability they request that we not sanction them.  If we had to provide this accommodation we would see our no-show rate increase.  Based on our history when we were not actively enforcing our no-shows we know that absent enforcement we will have about a 4% no-show rate up from our current 0.5%. Assuming that our no-show rate on grows to 4% it would cost us well over $500000 per year to provide this accommodation. 	The overarching point of these illustrative examples is to demonstrate that the NPRM vastly underestimates the volume and variety of reasonable modification requests that transit systems will have to review and accommodate.  It also demonstrates that the cost impacts of accommodating these reasonable modification requests will be extreme and clearly meets the federal standard of being significant.Direct ThreatThe department is proposing to change the definition of direct threat though this NPRM. The proposal states that direct threat only exists if there is a situation that is a threat to the health or safety of others rather than the current language which states that the threat could be to the disabled individual and or others.  While we agree with the stated reasons for the change (to insure that disabled individuals are not excluded on a subjective basis) our concern is that there are rare but legitimate reasons to exclude a person from our services on the basis of a threat to themselves.  The best example I can give is that of an individual with advanced age related dementia or Alzheimers.  We have had cases where we have transported such an individual to their destination and once we have dropped the individual off the individual has wandered away (didnt enter or turned around and walked away from their destination) and because the individual was not reasonably competent the police were called and a search initiated.  Where we have had repeated occurrences of this behavior we have denied such individuals the right to travel unescorted on the basis that they demonstrated that they were a direct threat to themselves.  We understand that the ADA regulations do not require us to insure the safe custodial delivery of riders.  However we are bound by state laws which require us to maintain an acceptable level of customer care.  Accordingly we must ensure that a passenger that has demonstrated a propensity to put themselves into harms way is not facilitated by our actions.  If we are not permitted use the direct threat authority we currently possess we would have to provide custodial care for these types of passengers.  The costs of this accommodation will vary but could easily cost us more than $70000 per year (the cost of one additional paratransit vehicle).   Disability Law Coordinating Council:The NPRM proposes to codify an existing internal administrative mechanism.  We do not understand why an internal administrative decision is an appropriate discussion for an NPRM unless the DLCC is intended for a more significant purpose than simply coordinating the various DOT administrations interpretations of disability law.  We believe that there is a perfectly reasonable purpose for an internal coordinating group however it imperative that this group not be allowed to function as de facto rule-making entity.  We strongly believe that anytime that the department is contemplating clarifications and or expanded interpretations of their regulations; they need to use a formal notice and comment process in order to gain insight on the proposal and potential unintended consequences of the departments proposals.Regulatory and AnalysisThe regulatory analysis and notices section of the NPRM certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on substantial number of small entities.  This is an utterly absurd statement.  The comment in the regulation is that the number of small transit systems that provide fixed route service is not expected to be large.  In Washington State the last series of grant awards of federal rural funding went to 60 different recipients.  Of these recipients better than 2/3 of the grantees operate some fixed route service.  This pattern is duplicated across the U.S.  In addition the NPRM states that the impact will not be significant because transit systems can choose to operate route deviated service in lieu of fixed route.  This statement is equally absurd because the language of the regulation specifically covers all services including route deviated services.  The notice also states that the will be no impact because the regulation includes an undue burden waiver provision at 37.151 - 37.155.  This statement is probably the most absurd of these series of statements because the FTA has not provided any mechanism to have an undue burden request approved.  In fact it is the policy of the FTA to only grant temporary time extensions of the requirements.  Further the FTA has stated in writing that these temporary time extensions must demonstrate that the entity will come into compliance within a set period of time.  This clearly indicates that regulated entities will have to incur the expenses thereby causing a significant impact on small entities.Summary:If we were too simply to accommodate these current modification requests we would have to increase our paratransit budget roughly $1.5 to $2 million per year an increase of 30 to 45 percent!   This would increase our current spending on ADA paratransit from 15.3% % of our total spending to 22%.  This increase would require us to eliminate approximately 15% of our highly disabled passenger utilized accessible fixed route bus service.  In our system this would probably require us to eliminate weekend service and because of the compounding impacts of the loss of riders we would have to continue to reduce service in out years due to the loss of fares and passenger generated incentive funding.  Further these cost estimates do not include the administrative and legal costs of documenting the requests and if we deny the request the cost of defending our decisions.  If our experience where we provide extensive door to door service would require us to increase ADA paratransit service by 30% is shared by the rest of transit systems in this country then we would see the national costs of paratransit increase from its current $1.8 billion (recent NTD data) to $2.7 billion.  Clearly this increase in costs would be significant and the proposed rulemaking should be evaluated under Executive Order 12866 and subjected to a rigorous economic analysis.Further we question the basic need for the proposed revision to regulations.  Since the regulations were first adopted in 1991 the transit industry has aggressively worked to comply and meet our obligations to customers with disabilities.  Industry wide since these regulations went into effect we have provided well over 1 billion ADA paratransit trips.  The vast vast majority of these trips were provided effectively timely and met the access needs of the riders.  Over the same period the FTA has received somewhere around 5000 complaints (based on verbal reports from the FTA Office of Civil Rights) on ADA services.  Of these roughly 5000 complaints the vast majority were determined to not be violations of the rules.  It seems that the department is seeking to unnecessarily upset what has been by any fair evaluation one of the great successes accessibility law and regulation.

F. R. Part 382Docket Number OST-2005-22298Any correspondence in relation to these comments should be sent to Danielle Chapman Thomsonfly Industry Affairs Wigmore House Wigmore PlaceWigmore LaneLutonLU2 9TNUKDanielle.chapman@uk.britanniaairways.comThomsonfly is writing in response to the NPRM in the Federal Register published on the 7th September 2005 on Non Discrimination on the basis of disability in Air Travel  Medical Oxygen and portable respiration assistive devices having had an opportunity to read and analyse its impact and effect on the operations and business of Thomsonfly. Thomsonfly a UK charter carrier and holder of a US Foreign Air Carrier permit welcomes the opportunity to comment on the proposals to require airlines to provide in flight medical oxygen.  Thomsonfly has long been committed to ensuring there is no discrimination in air travel and we have been a long term supporter and champion of the UK Voluntary Code of practice for Accessibility in Air Travel.  Thomsonfly also follows the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) recommendations in the field of facilitation as set out in Doc 30 part 1 section 5.Having had the chance to review and digest the NPRM Thomsonfly urges the Department to withdraw the proposed law as we believe the proposals are currently threatening flight safety will raise serious security concerns and will pose significant operational and financial concerns as well as being illegal on the ground of extra-territoriality. Extra-Territoriality Concerns1.	Thomsonfly is a UK registered carrier and as such considers the UK as its administrative home.  As with our arguments on the extension of the Air Carrier Access Act to foreign carriers any requirement on the part of US authorities to require foreign air carriers to meet domestic legislation should be constructed as being an extra-territorial application of legislative prerogative.2.	Thomsonfly recognises in certain situation that the current US legislation is effective extra-territoriality where the main aim is to protect US citizens abroad.  However as a UK registered carrier and regulated by the UK CAA or EU civil aviation institutions Thomsonfly does not sell eastbound originated seats to the UK and as a result the vast majority of Thomsonflys passengers are UK originating making the requirements highly burdensome for Thomsonfly as well as being contrary to the accepted principles of sovereignty.3.	Thomsonfly also believes the proposed rule will be inappropriate because of the imminent introduction of new European legislation and we agree with the comments of ECAC that the proposed rule is inappropriate because of the forthcoming introduction of European Law which will address the rights of disabled passengers and because of potential conflicts with national and European practices on safety and security.4.	Thomsonfly also notes that recently the Supreme Court ruled in the Spector et al v Norwegian Cruise lines Limited that domestic US legislation relating to the carriage of disabled passengers applied only where the policies procedures and facilities have an effect on US citizens and their rights.  As set out in paragraph 2 Thomsonfly carries mainly UK originating passengers and we would argue that Thomsonflys non-compliance with the proposed rule would have no detrimental affect on any US citizen and as such Thomsonfly should not be subject to the requirements of the proposed rule.Safety Concerns5.	Under requirement 382.133 placing the regulatory burden of testing respiratory assistive devices on the air carriers will provide a level of administration for the air carrier that is unreasonable.  Providing an up to date list of all the different respiratory devices for the number of different aircraft operated in an air carriers fleet is impractical and time consuming.6.	Thomsonfly also questions with the level of technological advancement how often these electrical devices will be updated and we believe it is only practicable that the manufactures of the respiratory devices should approach the aircraft manufactures to test and develop standards to certify these assistive devices.7.	Thomsonfly would also be concerned about the effects poorly maintained or malfunction models could potentially have on our aircraft and we do not believe that a one time test is enough to certify the equipment safe and compatible with aircraft systems.8.	The testing and certifying of the respiratory device by the aircraft manufacturer would save thousands of man hours and duplication of work around the commercial aviation industry as otherwise each individual carrier would have to test the same piece of equipments costing the industry an enormous amount.Security Concerns9.	Thomsonfly is also concerned about the security aspects of the proposed rule.  Encouraging passengers to take on their own oxygen cylinders creates additional security risks.  It would be very difficult for staff on the day to determine that the cylinders are filled with oxygen and not other noxious gases or explosive devices.10.	If the carrier is required the test the equipment and there is no standard of certified scheme for these devices to meet then it is impractical to expect check-in staff to be able to ensure on the day that the device has not been tampered with and that it is an approved oxygen system that indeed does contain oxygen. A scheme such as the defibrillator scheme where Boeing and Airbus carry out testing on the device and certify it for use onboard aircraft and at certain times of the flight should be pursued.Operational Issues11.	Thomsonfly does not believe the respiratory devices should be used during take off and landing because of safety concerns.  Those people who are reliant on respiratory devices will need to be provided with airline supplied supplemental oxygen during these periods.12.	Aircraft upgrades and downgrades.  If the aircraft type that the device has been tested and approved on has a technical problem and is swapped for a different aircraft type there is a risk that the device would potentially become an unsafe piece of equipment and the passengers would be delayed or denied boarding.  It would be wholly unsafe totally unreasonable and impractical for airlines to have to carry out last minute testing in these circumstances.13.	Aircraft mains power is often at a different voltage and frequency from power on the ground and therefore maybe incompatible with the operational use of these devices.14.	IATAs Dangerous Goods regulation conflicts with the DoTs requirement to require foreign carriers to carry respiratory devices or oxygen canisters.  The IATA Dangerous Goods regulation 1.2.4 states nothing contained in these regulations should be interpreted as. requiring an operator to transport a particular article of substance.15.	The IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations 2.3.4 also states the following goods are permitted on aircraft as checked or carry on baggage with the approval of the operator small gaseous or air cylinders required for medical use. The UK Civil Air Authority Dangerous Goods Office has determined that small is determined to be up to 18 inches long. 16.	Thomsonfly estimates that the content of an 18 inch cylinder (based on the cylinders we carry in the event of an onboard medical emergency) would last for approx 30 mins and that even for a short haul flight up to 4 cylinders would be needed.  This poses a problem as in a high density configured aircraft which is central to the survival of the charter airline business model operated by Thomsonfly; there is no space for storage of these cylinders within the cabin.17.	Thomsonfly also notes that recently the Supreme Court ruled in the Spector et al v Norwegian Cruise lines Limited that the foreign flagged cruise ships would also be exempted from any requirement that would create serious difficulties for the vessel and would have a serious impact on its operations.  Thomsonfly would again ask that as a UK registered carrier and as the majority of passengers carried are UK originating citizens Thomsonfly should be exempted from the requirements of the rule.Summary18.	Thomsonfly remains committed to ensuring the transport of disabled passengers but believes the proposed rule is unworkable unsafe and dangerous and place overly onerous requirements on the aviation industry.  Thomsonfly believes it should be withdrawn until the concerns highlighted above have been addressed and rectified in dialogue with the Aviation industry.","DOT-OST-2005-22298","Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel - Medical Oxygen and Portable Respiration Assistive Devices","Rulemaking","DOT-OST-2005-22298-0435","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2006-01-30T00:00:00-05:00","Danielle Chapman","Thomsonfly ",NA,"Thomsonfly Industry Affairs","Not Assigned"

"100","DOT",FALSE,0,"2006-01-05T23:59:59-05:00",NA,"We do not believe that Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act 42 U.S.C. 2000d provides authority for this guidance or for the underlying Executive Order.  We suggest that OST ask the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel for an opinion on this matter since it involves not only OST but many other Executive Branch agencies as well.The validity of our comments is buttressed by a Supreme Court decision Alexander v. Sandoval 121 S. Ct. 1511 (2001) that was handed down since the guidance first became effective on the last full day of the Clinton administration January 19 2001.  The events of last September 11 2001 also make this a good time to reassess the wisdom of executive-branch pronouncements that inevitably encourage the balkanization of the nation into ethnic enclaves.	Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance against any person in the United States on the ground of race color or national origin.  The guidance acknowledges that On its face Title VI prohibits only intentional discrimination.  Sandoval reaffirms the Supreme Courts earlier pronouncements that Title VI bans only disparate treatment not actions that have only disproportionate effects on this or that racial or ethnic group.	There is obviously a problem then if a federal agency promulgates regulations purporting to implement Title VI but that ban not only disparate treatment (which Title VI is aimed at) but also actions with only disproportionate effects (which the Supreme Court has said that Title VI allows).  The Court has long recognized that the difference between disparate treatment and disparate impact is one of kind not just degree.  See e.g. Washington v. Davis 426 U.S. 229 (1976).  Since a federal agency cannot even ban intentional discrimination without statutory authority see NAACP v. FPC 425 U.S. 662 (1976) then it would certainly seem to lack authority to ban actions that are not intentionally discriminatory when they have no statutory authority to do so.While the Sandoval decision did not invalidate Title VI disparate-impact regulationsthe Court concluded that the issue had not been presented to itfive justices on the Court strongly hinted that they might vote to do so in a future case.  The Sandoval majority noted We cannot help observing  how strange it is to say that disparate-impact regulations properly implement Title VI when the statute permits the very behavior that the regulations forbid.  The Court also noted that Title VI limits agencies to effectuat[ing] rights already created by it.  See 121 S. Ct. at 1516-17 1519 n.6 1521.  See also Thomas A. Lambert The Case against Private Disparate Impact Suits 34 Ga. L. Rev. 1155 1211-21 (2000) (discussing inter alia the Courts general rule that agency regulations may not be more prescriptive than the enabling statutes under which they are promulgated id. at 1214). Since Congress cannot transform a disparate-treatment ban into a disparate-impact ban see City of Boerne v. Flores 521 U.S. 507 (1997) it seems fair to conclude that a federal agency also lacks this authority.  The Court in Boerne said that Congresss font of authority Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment does not give it authority to make this fundamental transformation; a fortiori an agencys font of authority Title VI does not give it authority to make this fundamental transformation.  See Lambert 34 Ga. L. Rev. at 1218-21.Such a transformation is additionally problematic because a ban on disproportionate effects will in fact encourage race-consciousness and disparate treatmentthe very behavior that Congress sought to ban.  See Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio 490 U.S. 642 652-53 (1989); Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust 487 U.S. 977 992-94 & n.2 (1988) (plurality opinion); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody 422 U.S. 405 449 (Blackmun J. concurring in judgment).  Finally to the extent that Title VI regulations are applied to states (as they frequently are) problems are raised under Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon 473 U.S. 234 242 (1985) because Congress has not approved such incursions on state authority let alone approved them unequivocally.  And were Congress to have given agencies authority to rewrite the statute actually passed problems are raised under the nondelegation doctrine as well.	The justification for the disparate-impact approach is scanty and typically relies on one or more of three Supreme Court cases none of which is on point.  The first Alexander v. Choate 469 U.S. 287 293-94 (1985) was not a case about Title VI or its regulations; instead it involved the Rehabilitation Act which the Court was at pains to assert might well give agencies broader authority to promulgate disparate-impact regulations.   The other majority opinion sometimes cited is Lau v. Nichols 414 U.S. 563 568 (1974) but there is no discussion in this case at all of any regulations validity and in any event when Lau was decided the Court had not yet determined that Title VI banned only disparate treatment so the divergence between the statutes ban and the regulations could not have been authoritatively addressed.	The remaing case sometimes cited (and discussed by the majority in Alexander v. Choate) is Guardians Association v. Civil Service Commission 463 U.S. 582 (1983).  But to find in Guardians a bare majority for the proposition that agencies may promulgate disparate-impact regulations under Title VI one must add the opinion by Justice White to Justice Marshalls dissent and to Justice Stevens dissent (joined by Justices Brennan and Blackmun).  Four members of the CourtBurger Rehnquist Powell and OConnorexplicitly rejected this view.  Furthermore Justice White actually voted to affirm the holding below denying the plaintiff compensatory damages and also thought that the statute itself reaches disparate impact so [t]he question whether agency regulations under Title VI may forbid only disparate impact  thus remains open.  Lambert 34 Ga. L. Rev. at 1207; see also id. at 1203-25 (discussing why disparate-impact regulations are invalid under the Courts precedents).	In all events whatever tenuous authority these three decisions might have had was snapped by the Court's much more recent decision in Sandoval (and earlier by the Courts City of Boerne decision).  Clearly there are at least five justices who view the validity of disparate-impact regulations promulgated under Title VI as very much an open question and indeed indicated rather clearly that the regulations rest on dubious authority.And even if in some future case the Supreme Court rules that federal agencies have authority to write disparate-impact regulations that would not mean that they should do so especially given the many bad consequences that the disparate-impact approach has had for civil-rights law.  Thus the administration ought to be reassessing the use of the disparate-impact approach in all areas not required by statute and that includes Executive Order 13166.	Indeed the disparate-impact approach is especially untenable in the language area.  It equates the use of English with national-origin discrimination which is absurd.  Ability to speak English and ethnicity are obviously distinct qualities.  Some people of a particular national origin will not be able to speak English well but others will.  Conversely some people not of that particular national origin will also not be able to speak English well.  Thus the courts have overwhelmingly rejected claims that employers with a preference or even a requirement for speaking Englishpractices that go much further than the mere failure to make the positive accommodations that the guidance would requireare discriminating on the basis of national origin.  (These cases are collected and discussed in Barnaby Zall English in the Workplace (2000) (published by the Center for Equal Opportunity).)	The Supreme Courts decision in Espinoza v. Farah Manufacturing Co. 414 U.S. 86 (1973) is also instructive.  It held there that it was not national origin discrimination when an employer refused to hire a noncitizen.  The Courtper Justice Marshall with Justice Douglas the only dissenterendorsed an early EEOC opinion that `national origin refers to the country from which the individual or his forbears came  not whether or not he is a United States citizen (id. at 94).  The Court had noted Certainly the plain language of the statute supports [that] result (id. at 88) and that Title VIIs legislative history suggest[ed] that the terms national origin and ancestry were considered synonymous (id. at 89).  Whats more the Court expressly rejected the EEOCs attempt to ban discrimination against foreigners by arguing that it would have a disparate impact on the basis of national origin (id. at 92-95).  It would seem to follow that discrimination against all foreign languages doesnt violate the law; only discrimination against a language associated with a particular national origin.	While it is of course possible that a particular Title VI recipient might choose not to make its programs available in a language other than English as a way of discriminating against a particular ethnic group it seems fair to assume that the overwhelming majority of Title VI recipients use only English not out of any illicit motive but simply because of ease convenience and thrift.  Thus it is much fairer for the government to limit itself to going after recipients it suspects of disparate treatmentespecially since that is all the underlying statute prohibits.  There is no reason to assume recipients who use only English are guilty until they can show their good faith and a business necessity for their policy.  Nor is there any reason to assume that unless the federal government is requiring recipients to make programs available in English that they will not do so.  Many recipients will indeed accommodate non-English-speakers; but the decision of whether and how to do so should be and is theirs to make not the federal governments. 	Worse the guidance endorses the notion that America ought to be a multilingual nation and removes important incentives for all Americans to learn English.  A common tongue becomes more not less important as our nation grows more multiracial and multiethnic.  We must be able to communicate with one another and it is very damaging if the federal government is sending the message that learning English is not necessary for being an American.  In short as dubious as Executive Order 13166 is as a matter of law it is much worse as a matter of policy.  	Executive Order 13166 ought to be revoked.  Furthermore all agency regulations and guidance promulgated under Title VI that rely on the disparate-impact approach should be revoked as well.

All of PVAs members are individuals with disabilities under the ACAA and have a significant interest in the strongest possible implementation and enforcement of the ACAA.  Virtually all PVA members use wheelchairs for mobility and many fly frequently on official PVA business.  PVA employees board of directors and advisory committee members travel frequently enough to require the use of an in-house travel coordinator.  It is critical to the successful conduct of PVA business that air carriers fully understand their obligation to comply in every respect with the ACAA.  PVA believes that the Department's proposals promote clarity in understanding of the mutual obligations of air carriers and passengers with disabilities under the ACAA.  The question and answer format of the proposals appears to be a useful change while retaining the compulsory nature of regulations.  These comments will address the issues according to the order in which they are raised in the NPRM.Section 382.3:  What Do the Terms in This Rule Mean?PVA urges the Department to modify the term Facility to include rolling stock that belongs to the carrier.  Access to many regional jets and other planes is provided by a shuttle from the terminal.  These vehicles must be accessible to people with disabilities including people who use wheelchairs.Section 382.5:  To Whom Do the Provisions of This Rule Apply?As stated in the preamble the Department proposes ""to cover only those flights operated by a foreign air carrier that begin or end at a US airport.  Aircraft accessibility requirements would apply only to those aircraft that are used for these flights.""  PVA understands that this proposal is premised on the Department's view that ""it would exceed the scope of the Department's authority to attempt to apply ACAA requirements to all the operations of a foreign air carrier.""  PVA supports the Department's proposal particularly in light of its explanation of what constitutes a flight that ""begins or ends at a US airport"" and the definition of what constitutes a continuous journey on a segmented flight.Section 382.7:  What May Foreign Carriers Do If They Believe a Provision of a Foreign Nation's Law Precludes Compliance with the Provision of This Part?PVA understands the need for a waiver provision for foreign carriers but is concerned that this exception will eventually swallow the rule.  Therefore PVA strongly supports the proposed regulatory language expressing the exacting standards to which the Department will hold a foreign carrier seeking a waiver.Section 382.15:  Do Carriers Have To Make Sure That Contractors Comply With the Requirements of This Part?PVA strongly supports the proposed language codifying the Department's interpretations of provisions governing the relationship between contractors and air carriers.  These provisions are that contractors (including airports) must meet the same requirements that would apply to the carrier itself in providing the services in question that a contractor's noncompliance is a material breach of its contract with the carrier that the assurance must commit the contractor to complying with all applicable provisions of the rule with respect to all activities performed for the carrier that the carrier remains responsible for the contractor's compliance and that carriers cannot defend against DOT enforcement actions by saying that their noncompliance was the contractor's fault.With the development of website travel agencies new options have opened up for air travelers.  These websites are important contractors with airlines that must be accessible to people with disabilities.  In this regulation these must be included either in the definition of indirect carriers or clearly specified as contractors.  Either way they must comply with the accessibility guidelines in 36 CFR Part 1194.25.The Department seeks comment regarding its interpretation of paragraph (c) of proposed section 382.15 that as drafted it would apply only to U.S. carriers with respect to U.S. travel agents.  The Department's rationale for not proposing to cover foreign airlines or foreign travel agents under this provision is that rules concerning relationships between U.S. carriers and foreign travel agents or foreign carriers and their travel agents could prove very difficult to monitor and enforce.  PVA understands the difficulty in monitoring the actions of foreign travel agents but does not agree that they should be entirely exempt.  Domestic carriers may provide reservation systems for use by travel agents.  Those that do generally provide a daily bulletin of information for travel agents.  Foreign travel agents are responsible for a great deal of trips that end or begin in the United States and must be made aware of these provisions.  Domestic and foreign carriers must provide via websites phone lines or brochures information about the substance of this rule particularly as it applies to indirect carriers to foreign travel agents with whom they deal.  At the very least the Department should accept complaints regarding behavior of foreign contractors and comment to the best of its ability on the legality of the foreign contractors actions under the ACAA.Section 382.19:  May Carriers Refuse To Provide Transportation on the Basis of Disability?The Department proposes language that ""would clarify the basis on which an air carrier may deny transportation to a passenger. In addition to updating the citations to statutory and regulatory provisions that provide a basis for excluding passengers from a flight . . . the NPRM uses the concept of direct threat as the standard for when a carrier may conclude that there is a safety basis for excluding a passenger from a flight.""PVA disagrees with the introduction of this concept into the regulations.  Specific FAA or TSA safety regulations must continue to be the sole source of discretion for air carriers who think it necessary to exclude passengers with disabilities or take other action on the basis of safety.Over the years PVA has had to refute arguments from the airline industry that people with disabilities threaten their own and others' safety in air travel.  Past efforts by the industry to limit the number of mobility impaired passengers make evident that the concept of  direct threat is liable to be misused and to deny transportation to people with disabilities.   In the stressful and hurried air travel context such instantaneous determinations by carrier personnel are likely to be at best subjective and could rise to the level of blanket categorizations.   There is no evidence to support the idea that refusal should be permitted on any basis other than safety or violations of federal regulation.    In our view introducing the concept of ""direct threat"" would inevitably lead to greater denial of transportation.Should the Department introduce the concept of ""direct threat"" the regulatory language must make it clear that the direct threat is limited to a potential threat to the health and safety of other passengers and not to the passenger himself.  Air carriers must not be permitted to substitute their judgment for that of the passenger with a disability.  The Department should be mindful of Chevron v. Echazabal 536 US 73 (2002).  In Chevron the Supreme Court upheld anEqual Employment Opportunity Commission regulatory provision for the ADA that allows employers to consider a threat to self reason to refuse to hire applicants with disabilities.  The Supreme Court interpreted the regulation in this manner despite the fact that in the language of the ADA Congress recognized a direct threat defense only for dangers posed to other workers.Section 382.29:  May a Carrier Require a Passenger With a Disability To Travel With a Safety Assistant?PVA does not object to the NPRMs use of the term safety assistant'' rather than the term attendant'' in current Section 382.35.  We are concerned however with the explanatory language that ""A safety assistant is someone who accompanies a passenger with a disability in order to provide assistance in the event of an emergency such as an evacuation of the aircraft.""  Our concern is premised on the practice of some air carriers to require quadriplegics and others with severe mobility impairments to travel with attendants simply because they may not be able to physically assist with an emergency evacuation to the satisfaction of air carrier personnel.  The Department should make clear its long-standing policy that so long as a passenger with a disability can communicate to others how best to physically assist him in the event an evacuation is necessary he should be free to travel unaccompanied.Section 382.43: Must information and reservation services of carriers be accessible to individuals with hearing and vision impairments?The Department asks in this section whether passengers with disabilities should be able to request accommodations through carrier websites.  PVA strongly supports this requirement.  Carriers offer special fares and frequent flyer offers through web booking.  While a passenger with a disability could make a reservation online (providing the site is accessible) it is not usual practice because any request for particular seating or transfer assistance must be a separate telephone call.   Online request for special services provides both the passenger and air carrier personnel written records of the request and response which is not generally available when the request is made by phone.  Adjusting websites to incorporate this provision is a reasonable step for carriers and provides passengers with disabilities equivalent use of this convenient means of booking.Section 382.51:  What Requirements Must Carriers Meet Concerning the Accessibility of Airport Facilities?PVA believes that domestic carriers should continue to comply with ADAAG accessibility standards in foreign airports to the extent that it does not interfere with foreign regulations or standards.  Consistency is very important to all passengers and for the most part should be required where feasible.	Kiosks have become a common and sometimes preferred means of checking in at the airport; in fact some carriers provide only kiosks with agents available for assistance.  It is critical that kiosks are accessible to people with disabilities including those who use wheelchairs and those with vision impairments.  Kiosks should meet spatial and reach ranges specified in revised ADAAG Section 707.  Communications aspects should be covered by ADAAG 707 and 36 CFR 1194.25 as the Department suggests.Section 382.55:  What Requirements Apply to Carriers' Security Screening Procedures?Proposed Section 382.55 recognizes that the Transportation Security Administration now controls security screening at U.S. airports and that there may be foreign legal requirements for security screening at foreign airports that are not subject to ACAA regulation.  However the proposal also anticipates the possibility that some air carriers may choose to conduct security screening procedures that go beyond those carried out under TSA or foreign legal requirements.  Consequently for such additional carrier-imposed procedures the Department proposes to carry forward the substance of current Section 382.49 and seeks comment on whether this is necessary.  PVA believes that it is necessary to carry forward the current language especially if Congress should once again privatize security screenings.Section 382.61:  What Are the Requirements for Movable Aisle Armrests?PVA strongly supports paragraph (c)s explicit statement that movable aisle armrests must be provided proportionately in all classes of service in the entire passenger cabin.  As stated in the preamble ""if 80 percent of the aisle seats on the aircraft in which passengers with mobility impairments may sit are in coach and 20 percent are in first class then 80 percent of the movable aisle armrests must be in coach with 20 percent in first class.""  This express regulatory requirement is long overdue.PVA also strongly supports the Department's proposal to remove the current exception for types of seats in which incorporating movable aisle armrests would not be feasible.   PVA has not seen evidence showing that any particular sort of seat truly makes the use of movable aisle armrests infeasible.  PVA members experiences support the Departments belief that this exception has led to a lack of movable armrests and therefore a lack of accessibility in some classes of service for some carriers.PVA also requests that the location of these movable armrests be easily determinable particularly to flight personnel.  Years ago representatives of the air transportation industry indicated that once they were required movable armrests would be placed on all seats save a few.  This has not turned out to be the case though PVA cannot perceive of a reason it could not be so.  Movable armrests are virtually indistinguishable from others and do not fold up as easily as those on inside seats.  Our members have sat in boarding chairs waiting as flight attendants go up and down aisles trying to locate and then operate a movable armrest.    PVA requests that in this section or elsewhere flight personnel be specifically trained in the operation of movable armrests and if they are not universally in place a diagram of their locations be available on board.Section 382.63 What Are the Requirements for Accessible Lavatories?This section carries forward the requirements of current Section 382.21(a)(3).  It would make explicit that carriers may but are not required to install accessible lavatories in single-aisle aircraft.  PVA appreciates the Departments recognition that the absence of accessible lavatories on single-aisle aircraft can create inconvenience and difficulty for many passengers with disabilities. The Department seeks comment on whether it would be desirable and feasible practically and economically to require accessible lavatories on at least some new single-aisle aircraft (e.g. those above a certain seating capacity).PVA supports rulemaking requiring accessible lavatories in new single aisle aircraft of at least 100 seats or aircraft undergoing total reconfiguration.PVA participated in a DOT Federal Advisory Committee in the mid-1990s for designing onboard lavatories in single aisle aircraft.  With a single exception the aeronautical engineers from major manufacturers were able to design this accessibility into existing aircraft.  Aircraft manufacturers clearly stated in this exercise that they would/could design anything the carrier requested as long as it was structurally viable.PVA recognizes the burdens of imposing new costs on economically fragile air carriers but believes that it is time that this provision be seriously considered and implemented.  Section 382.67:  What Is the Requirement for Priority Space in the Cabin To Store Passenger Wheelchairs?In 1991 PVA commissioned a study on appropriate dimensions for a storage space for a folding wheelchair.  After consultation with each major manufacturer and the ANSI/RESNA wheelchair standards committee the recommendation was made that adequate dimensions would be 43 long 14 wide and 40 high.  Unless new information has been developed PVA believes that these dimensions would be more accurate than those specified in the regulation.  PVA would be glad to provide this information to the Department as needed.The Department also seeks comment on whether the proposed rule should codify its current enforcement policy permitting ""carriers to comply with the requirements for passenger wheelchair stowage space across two or three seats using a strap kit approved by the FAA rather than to retrofit an aircraft possibly involving the removal of seats to provide the designated wheelchair space.""PVA accepts this practice as an effective means of satisfying the requirement for existing aircraft but believes that it is not and should not be the only feasible means of stowing a passengers wheelchair on board on planes that have yet to be constructed or have seats installed.  The final rule should require a designated protected area that is capable of accommodating a passenger's folding wheelchair in each new or reconfigured aircraft.Section 382.81:  For Which Passengers Must Carriers Make Seating Accommodations?Section 382.83:  Through What Mechanisms do Carriers Make Seating Accommodations?Section 382.85:  What Seating Accommodations Must Carriers Make to Passengers in Circumstances not Covered by Sec. 382.81 (a) Through (d)?These sections carry forward the requirements of current Sec. 382.38 restructured for greater clarity. The Department seeks comment on whether other seating accommodations should be added to fill gaps if any in the existing provision.  In the initial rulemaking seats with movable armrests were designated to be available to anyone using a boarding chair.  We strongly urge that DOT require that bulkhead seats also be available for reservation to passengers using personal wheelchairs.  PVA members have been refused the opportunity to reserve these seats in advance and told to call back within 24 hours of the flight and/or arrive at the airport early.  Upon taking either of those actions our members find that bulkhead seats have been assigned to other passengers and have no access to them because it is not specified in this regulation.Wheelchair users can frequently get into bulkhead seats without having to use a boarding chair if they are able to get down the first class aisle in their personal wheelchair.  Avoiding those extra transfers and the awkward maneuvering down the aisle in a boarding chair (once referred to as a necessary evil by an air carrier representative) makes the boarding process safer and easier for both passengers and personnel.  We strongly recommend that bulkhead seating be made available to wheelchair users upon request.  At the very least those seats should be able to be reserved by wheelchair users with the proviso that should passengers with a either a service animal or an immobilized leg require that seat the wheelchair user could be bumped.Section 382.91:  What Assistance Must Carriers Provide to Passengers With a Disability in Moving Within the Terminal?The proposed rule contains requirements concerning assistance in moving through the terminal other than in connecting flight situations.  The Department seeks comment on whether in the situation where a passenger is arriving at an airport to begin a journey it is reasonable for the carrier to be able to require advance notice for meeting the passenger to provide the assistance required in this section.PVA generally objects to advance notice requirements unless extreme or unusual provisions are requested.  We understand the logic of advance notice for service to be provided upon arrival at an airport.  If this regulation imposes this requirement it should reflect as in other provisions the requirement for the carrier to provide the assistance without advance notice if it can do so without delaying the flight.  A more critical service for wheelchair users is access to their personal wheelchairs when feasible for transfers to connecting flights.   Many travelers even with extended layovers have been told that their own wheelchair cannot be brought to them but must be transferred directly to the connecting flight.  This leaves them basically stranded and reliant on carrier personnel for any activity including use of the bathroom during a layover.   PVA believes that providing a personal wheelchair enables passengers to travel more independently and does not impose an undue burden on the carrier.  Any time limitation on providing this accommodation for a layover should require carrier personnel to check on possible delay of connecting flights.Another service that must be provided for wheelchair using passengers is accessible intraterminal transportation.  Mobile carts are used in most airports to transport passengers with long distances to gates and yet these carts are still not accessible to wheelchair users seventeen years after enactment of the ACAA.  Wheelchair users must either push or be pushed extensive distances while ambulatory passengers ride by on carts.  Carts whether owned by the carrier or a contractor must be required to provide access to wheelchair users.Section 382.93:  Must Carriers Offer Preboarding to Passengers With a Disability?PVA concurs with the Departments belief that providing a preboarding option for passengers is an essential accommodation for seating stowage and other activities that are more difficult for passengers with disabilities than other people.  In light of the requirement for preboarding for the opportunity to store a personal wheelchair on board we believe that carriers must offer this service.  PVA supports the NPRMs proposal to require a preboarding opportunity for passengers with disabilities.Section 382.95:  What Are Carriers' General Obligations With Respect to Boarding Deplaning and Connecting Assistance?The Department seeks comment on whether the requirement that carriers provide this assistance ""promptly"" should be more specific (e.g. by including a time frame or by requiring that carriers ensure that deplaning assistance is provided to passengers with disabilities who will use an aisle chair for deplaning no later than the time that the aircraft aisle is clear of other passengers such that the aisle chair can be brought to the passenger's aircraft seat).  PVA agrees with the Departments objective to address the many situations in which passengers who need assistance in deplaning have been left on board aircraft for an unreasonable length of time but are concerned that any specific designation will become a maximum performance standard.  That is that if a time limit of 15 minutes is specified (which PVA believes is too long in any case) that timing will become the common practice among carriers.  We strongly object to any reference to the time that all other passengers have left the plane.PVA does not disagree with the use of the word ""promptly"" or its flexible application in a multitude of circumstances.  We suggest that regulatory guidance be included in the final rule explaining that ""promptly"" means as soon as needed even if the plane is not empty of other passengers.  We note that passengers needing assistance with transfers to connecting flights would be hugely affected by any reference to the aisles being clear of other passengers.  People who use wheelchairs are forced to sit even when passengers have been requested to wait to allow others with tight connections to exit the plane first until the last passenger is off.  They frequently miss flights that others on the same flight are able to make due to this practice.   There is no current requirement in the regulation that essentially requires that all other passengers be off the plane before the passenger with a disability is able to deplane; PVA objects to that practice being accepted by the Department much less put into regulatory language.We also request the Department to clarify that boarding assistance includes assistance with transfers to and from the boarding chair if accepted or requested.  We recently heard from a person who was informed that airline personnel were not required to assist a passenger in getting out of his seat and in fact that he needs to bring his own assistant to do so.  While we believe this is unusual and such assistance is generally provided  the Department should specify that transfer assistance is required by this part.We also urge the Department to specifically require that vertical access from the terminal to the tarmac be located as close to the plane as possible so that people with mobility disabilities who must change levels by elevator are not forced to move a great distance to their plane or shuttle.  Section 382.97:  To which aircraft does the requirement to provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts apply?PVA recently had a report from a member of an elderly relative who used a scooter that was raised in a boarding lift while in her scooter.  At that point she was informed that her scooter could go no farther and she had to walk across the boarding platform to the plane.   Understandably this upset her terribly and she was terrified while making that crossing.  She changed her return flight so that she would not encounter this problem again.  When asked that she be informed in the future when this type of boarding would be required she was told that they could not ensure that a lift would not be used.  We believe that the Department should include this information in Section 382.41(c) as information that must be provided to passengers with disabilities.   More importantly we believe that the Department must specifically require that passengers needing to use a lift to board an aircraft be secured in boarding chairs unless they refuse that accommodation.Section 382.131:  Do Baggage Liability Limits Apply to Mobility Aids and Other Assistive Devices?The Department seeks comment on how liability for loss of or damage to wheelchairs and other assistive devices should be handled in the case of international transportation since the domestic baggage liability limits of 14 CFR Part 254 as well as the exception to these limits that this section in effect creates do not apply to international transportation.  The Department should simply assert that the same rules that apply to domestic carriers for calculating the compensation for a lost damaged or destroyed wheelchair or other assistive device apply equally to foreign air carriers.  If foreign air carriers believe that Warsaw or Montreal Convention liability limits dictate a different result they are free to apply for a waiver under proposed Section 382.7. Section 382.141:  What Training Are Carriers Required To Provide for Their Personnel?The NPRM would add a provision requiring the development of training in consultation with disability community organizations. The Department seeks comment on the application of this proposed requirement to foreign carriers.  PVA would not object to the Department waiving this requirement if a foreign carrier can demonstrate it made good faith efforts to contact disability community organizations in its home country but was unable to do so.Section 382.143:  When must Carriers Complete Training for their Personnel?PVA believes that one year is adequate time for foreign carriers to complete their training but that the deadline for domestic carriers should be six months.  The substantive changes in this regulation are not complicated ACAA training is a regular part of carrier training and carriers do refresher training on a regular basis.  It is not an undue burden for domestic carriers to provide targeted training to the appropriate personnel on the changes in this rule within six months.Section 382.145:  What Must Carriers Incorporate in Their Manuals?The NPRM would delete the requirement of current Section 382.63 for carriers to establish ACAA compliance programs and submit them to the Department for review.  Instead the NPRM would require all carriers to incorporate their procedures for complying with ACAA requirements in their manuals training materials and guidance for their personnel and make them available to the Department on its request.PVA does not object to the requirement to incorporate their procedures into their manuals but believes that the Department rather than reviewing manuals only upon request should require at least an initial submission of that manual for review.  A simple submission of certification of compliance is insufficient to ensure compliance with this part.  Section 382.151:  What Are the Requirements for Providing Complaints Resolution Officials?PVA agrees with the Department that ""In any situation in which a person raises a disability-related issue and a carrier's personnel do not resolve the issue immediately to the customer's satisfaction the carrier's personnel must immediately inform the customer of the right to contact a Complaints Resolution Official (CRO).""  Despite repeated attempts to make ACAA information available PVA members and many others with disabilities are unaware of the existence of or responsibility of CROs.  Experience has shown that even carrier personnel are unfamiliar with this term and with the requirement to make the ACAA regulations available and will locate to their manager only if specifically requested.  PVA supports the requirement that the airline make passengers aware of this resource when a passenger's disability-related concern has not been addressed to the customer's satisfaction by the carrier's staff.ConclusionPVA appreciates the opportunity to respond to the issues raised by the Department and supports the Department's strong advocacy for equal access to the skies.
