Environmental activist groups like NRDC are integral to green litigation and lobbying machine, while simultaneously serving as close allies and partners with the Obama EPA to advance a shared mission. June 25, 2013, Obama announced a plan to have the U.S EPA or Agency issue rules under section 111 of the Clean Air Act to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Committee's oversight into these rules and role NRDC played in developing the proposed rules, which rebuts much of the Obama Administration's narrative about how these rules were developed. Report documents previously unknown details about relationship between EPA and environmental activist groups and ""sue-and-settle"" process that led to these rules. 2015, EPA released its final rules regulating carbon emissions from power plants. EPA efforts to regulate carbon emissions from power plants were driven by Obama Administration officials and ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST groups who worked to fulfill Obama climate commitments pages 15-17, 29, 50,56. EPA rushed into a ""sue-and-settle"" agreement with Natural Resources Defense Council, other environmental activists, and several state and local governments in 2010 to issue unprecedented carbon regulations with LITTLE REGARD to the technical, legal, and policy challenges that rules would present. pages 14-19, 21, 26, 30-39, 45-48, 56,61. EPA played politics with regulatory process by trying to manipulate rulemaking deadlines to avoid a public backlash close to 2012 Presidential and 2014 midterm elections, and to push implementation to next Administration, pages 16, 17, 31-34, 40-49, 55,64. The carbon rules were the product of quintessential ""sue-and-settle"" scheme where EPA and environmental activists, such as NRDC, continued to negotiate BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, changing regulatory actions and deadlines without providing the public meaningful notice or opportunity to comment. pages 17-19, 24, 26, 31,40-45 Obama EPA officials repeatedly MISLED the American people, news media, and Congress about negotiations with environmental activists and contribution made by these activists to development of carbon rules. pages 4-6,43, 47, 48, 54, 62-64,67. The White House, EPA, and environmental activists worked together to manage the public message on the carbon rules. pages 28-29, 33-35, 39, 46, 47, 50-51, 54,68. The litigation settlement provided environmental activists significant leverage to drive timing of EPA's rulemaking and to influence scope of its policies.pages 30-32, 35, 40-46, 67 EPA's process for developing the carbon rules appears to have DEVIATED FROM THE AGENCY STATUTORY AUTHORITY under the Clean Air Act and established policies and circumvented transparency laws and public participation requirements. pages 22, 23, 28, 32, 43, 48-49, 62-64. NRDC and other environmental activist groups have worked with EPA to shore up the shaky basis for carbon rules, issuing public statements criticizing opponents of rule and submitting detailed legal analyses for EPA to rely on and cite in its rulemaking documents. pages 59-68 . EPA and environmental activists had cozy relationships and egregiously used personal emails and held meetings away from EPA headquarters, thereby avoiding public transparency. pages 20, 22, 25, 28, 39, 43, 48,54-56. In addition to detailing overt ""sue-and-settle"" tactics, Report reveals how environmental activist groups including Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and EPA INAPPROPRIATELY coordinated a public message on climate. The Administration went out of its way to mislead the American public about the timing and scope of these rules, stating repeatedly that it had ""no plans"" to regulate existing power plants even though it had been working behind scenes with its environmental allies to do it. Only after his reelection did Obama intervene to set in motion EPA action that would fulfill his original climate campaign promises before leaving office. Environmentalists proved to be big cheerleaders for Obama and EPA, but groups such as NRDC were basically an extension of the Agency, providing policy advice, data and modeling, legal counsel.

END OR REPEAL THE independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by Dodd-Frank, the concern goes well beyond lack of regulatory review : there exists a fundamental lack of accountability, repeal Dodd-Frank, review and cancel Carbon rules on commodities trading exchange.","DOT-OST-2017-0069","Notice of Regulatory Review","Nonrulemaking","DOT-OST-2017-0069-1488","Posted","Public Submission",1,TRUE,"2017-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","e r","Comment from Anonymous",NA,NA,NA

This scheme allows money originating from foreign countries like Russia to funnel through Bermuda-based shell companies to environmental groups in the United States with the aim of disrupting the U.S. energy industry. These allegations are ripe for investigation by the Department of Treasury. These funds are dispersed as grants that will be used to execute a political agenda driven by Russian entities. a Bermuda based corporation apparently established to act only as a pass through for foreign funds , provides a number of services, including those necessary to facilitate the operations of a shell company.

GREATEST PROBLEM AMERICA FACES TODAY IN AMERICA ARE   ENVIRONMENTALISTS,   USING THE Endangered Species Act (ESA)  with the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA)  TO STOP BUSINESS AND HUMANS FROM USING THE RESOURCES ,by   exert more control disguised as helping animals and the environment .

David Valadao (CA-21)    of the House of Representatives  formed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Working Group in May 2013 to examine a variety of questions related to ESA implementation.      Example, CALIFORNA  1998 construction of an elementary school in San Diego was delayed by ESA litigation and FWS mitigation requirements to protect a two-inch shrimp. Construction is finally slated to go forward as a result of an agreement by the school district to spend $5 million in ESA mitigation expenses, all of which will be passed on to local citizens,  EXAMPLE  TEXAS Department of Transportation has been forced to completely redesign the highway project design and submit it for federal approval.  A   spider halted completion of an $11 million water pipeline project.  EXAMPLE MONTANA,  a mining project  has been told by the FWS that it will need to pay for contractors to help them complete a biological opinion related to grizzly bears, without any assurance the project will be approved.  EXAMPLE UTAH,  A rural electric cooperative in Utah was determined that two acres of Utah Prairie Dog habitat were within a 350-foot buffer of the project's right-of-way. This resulted in a nine-month delay ...... Current implementation of ESA does not clearly identify what is needed to recover and delist species, resulting in a lack of incentives, for state and private conservation, costly mandates, and wasted resources even in light of increased federal funding. ESA punishes private property owners and water rights holders and fails to properly account for huge economic and regulatory burdens that also hinder species conservation. The ESA also advances the agendas of groups seeking land and water acquisition and control. Working Group Conclusion: The ESA promotes a lack of data transparency and science guiding ESA-related decisions, and there are conflicts of interest and bias in ""peer review"" of federal ESA decisions. ESA is increasingly becoming a tool for litigation and taxpayer-funded attorneys' fees. The Obama Administration's use of closed-door settlements undermines transparency and involvement of affected stakeholders and drives arbitrary mandates and deadlines that do little to recover species. In 2012, the Department of Justice (DOJ) provided the House Committee on Natural Resources case information on 613 total cases. ESA shuts out states, tribes, local governments, and private landowners not only in key ESA decisions but in actual conservation activities to preserve and recover species.

This act, as amended, requires, among other things, that all agencies annually identify and review programs and activities that may be susceptible to significant improper payments.

According to the California Forestry Association, environmentalists filed more than 50 appeals in just one county to block thinning projects that sought to protect the Northern Spotted Owl habitat that had been destroyed by fire.   In addition, a lawsuit filed by one group led to a federal court order last year that could block state allocation of existing water rights.  The four federal land management agencies (the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and the FWS) are responsible for managing over 600 million acres of land or nearly one-third of the United States. Decades of failed federal forest management have created unhealthy and overstocked forests, placing 73 million acres of National Forest lands and 397 million acres of forest land nationwide at risk of severe wildfire.   Fires are destroying species habitat and ESA itself is creating obstacles that are counter-productive to fighting wildfires, including use of heavily mechanized equipment, use of aerial retardant and restricted use of water due to concerns about potential impacts to other ESA-listed species, such as salmon. State and tribal lands adjoining federal forest lands are increasingly at risk of wildfires partly because of ESA. The Forest Service's self-described ""analysis paralysis,"" excessive appeals on timber sales, ESA-related litigation, statutory and administrative land designations (such as wilderness, roadless areas and critical habitat) all serve to delay or outright block management activities necessary to reduce hazardous fuels and improve forest health and habitat. For example, in northwestern Montana, the Kootenai National Forest Supervisor approved an Environmental Impact Statement to proceed with the Grizzly Vegetation Management project on 2,360 acres. The proposed activities included timber harvest, fuels reduction, prescribed burning, pre-commercial thinning, wildlife habitat improvement, and watershed rehabilitation. In late 2009, several environmental groups filed suit under the ESA, claiming these activities would harm grizzly bear habitat. A federal district court judge granted an injunction in 2010, which effectively blocked the management activities, and awarded the plaintiff's attorneys' fees in the amount of $56,000. This area was recently identified by the National Interagency Fire Center as being at a ""significant risk of wildfire."" Over the past two fiscal years alone,  lawsuits, notices of lawsuits, and appeals were filed in the Idaho and Montana region of the U.S. Forest Service to block timber thinning and other vegetation management in areas at high risk of wildfire.   Endangered species habitat destruction was a reality last year, when the Arizona Game and Fish Department noted that two major fires resulted in the destruction of 20 percent of Mexican spotted owl nests known to exist in the world.  In addition, biologists scrambled last year to protect endangered fish in New Mexico from the Whitewater-Baldy Complex fire, which consumed almost 300,000 acres. Chairman Bishop (R-UT) said after the February 5, 2016  finalization of a new policy for defining and designating critical habitat under the     Endangered Species Act.  ""Just like we saw with WOTUS, this is another power grab.  The new definition injects even more ambiguity and confusion into an already arbitrary process.  This Obama Administration doesn't care if they abuse the law as long as they can exert more control over people.   If we've learned anything from the Obama Administration's handling of the endangered manatee, this agenda has nothing to do with improving habitat or protecting species. It's their way to exert more control disguised as helping animals and the environment.""","DOT-OST-2017-0069","Notice of Regulatory Review","Nonrulemaking","DOT-OST-2017-0069-0762","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2017-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","anonymous anonymous","Comment from Anonymous",NA,NA,NA

Washington, D.C.  - A new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report requested by Senator James Inhofe (R-OK), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and Senator David Vitter (R-LA), a member of the EPW Committee, was released today.  Under various statutes, EPA and the Treasury Department are required to reward attorneys' fees to plaintiffs that successfully challenge EPA. Based on a snapshot of EPA's litigation from 1995-2010, the report finds that environmental groups (ENGOs) profited more than any other plaintiff. The report includes litigation costs for all EPA environmental statutes except the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). one litigant-Earthjustice-received $4,655,425.60 or 32 percent of all attorneys' fees paid to EPA litigants. The GAO report uncovers, for the first time, the millions of taxpayer dollars that are going to attorneys' fees for environmental litigation against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Yet the report is limited because GAO, the government watchdog, was unable to obtain information from several federal agencies during the requested time period from 1995-2010. In addition to attorneys' fees awarded, the GAO found that the Department of Justice (DOJ) spent at least $43 million in taxpayer dollars defending EPA in court from 1998 - 2010.  Further, the report uncovered that most of the attorneys' fees paid to environmental organizations were paid under the Clean Air Act, followed next by the Clean Water Act. The report is part of a continued effort by Senators Inhofe and Vitter to ensure greater transparency at EPA. ...... Senator Inhofe: ""Today's GAO report is the tip of the iceberg as we work to get to the bottom of just how many taxpayer dollars are going to pay attorneys' fees in environmental suits.  It is outrageous that these agencies couldn't provide the requested information and it is even more concerning that we have yet to get the full story. lack of transparency on the part of EPA, DOJ, and the Department of Treasury as GAO was unable to obtain information for several years of litigation payments.  Senator Vitter: ""The GAO report shows that taxpayers have been on the hook for years while 'Big Green' trial lawyers have raked in millions of dollars suing the government.  Even worse, because of sloppy record keeping by the EPA and other agencies and a lack of cooperation by the Justice Department, we're not even sure how bad the problem really is. This is unacceptable and I'm going to continue working to demand greater transparency."" Government Accountability Office (GAO) uncovered a troubling lack of transparency and accountability in record keeping regarding environmental litigation expenses incurred in EPA litigation. Specifically, GAO found: Inconsistent formatting of key data elements produced significant problems for completing our analysis and required significant manual review by GAO and Justice.The Department of Justice does not have a standard approach for maintaining key data on environmental litigation cases, and the data they do collect are in two separate databases that do not collect the same type of data on environmental cases. EPA does not track its attorneys' time by case, GAO was not able to include data on EPA attorney costs spent on environmental litigation cases. GAO was unable to calculate the total number of hours that Justice Attorneys worked on environmental cases - and hence, total costs of attorney time - because the U.S. Attorneys' time is not tracked by case.The Department of Treasury does record data on payments made from its Judgment Fund, an account within the Treasury Department authorized under the Equal Access to Justice Act for rewarding attorneys' fees to successful plaintiffs, but does not publish them.The government may also incur other costs associated with litigation, including the costs of revising regulations in response to lawsuits, EPA overhead costs, and costs associated with delays in EPA permitting, but GAO did not have reliable data to quantify these costs.

The greenhouse gas emissions alone from wildfires can be equivalent to more than 8.5 million passenger vehicles driven for a year . .........2015 Subcommittee Chairman Tom McClintock (CA-04), ""The greatest threat to many endangered species and their habitat is catastrophic WILDFIRE..... Yet rather than thinning the forest to protect this habitat, we're spending millions upon millions on extraordinarily long, complicated, voluminous documents that IMPEDE our ability to properly manage the forests for the benefit of all species""...... Ozone is NOT OIL AND GAS COMPANIES ...Extreme events of WILDFIRES have significant impacts on air quality especially when they occur during periods conducive to ozone formation, Findings demonstrate a clear impact of wildfires on surface O3 nearby and potentially far downwind from the fire location, which means it is not in the Flawed EPA report for Greenhouse gas.

Not surprisingly, the clear and present danger of high-intensity fires on public lands in California have increased significantly over the last 20 years. Besides reducing the risk of catastrophic fire, trees in a restored healthy forest are more resistant to insect predation. POOR MANAGEMENT ALSO HAS LESS WATER FOR THE PEOPLE ....Being thinned, trees create right-sized gaps in the canopy to allow snow to fall to the ground yet receive enough shade to be protected from melting too early, unlike closed canopies from too many trees where 15 to 60 percent of snow never reaches the ground and is lost to evaporation. Further, in restored forests faster growing large trees sequester carbon faster than smaller trees.

""I think there are environmental consequences to any action we take, and if we're not cautious and careful and cooperative toothat can cause harm,"" Schulz reiterated during the hearing.

There has to be flexibility in the HOS with the ability to start and stop the clock instead of a ""do it all in this amount time"" mentality. The HOS takes in to account very few variables drivers face while transporting the goods the nation depends on, such as traffic slow downs, waiting times at shippers and receivers, waiting to fuel, etc.  The ELD has a tracking device component. And under the Supreme Court case US vs Jones (2012) a tracking device on a vehicle to monitor a vehicle's movement constitutes a search under the Forth Amendment. Just because the trucking industry is unfortunately so regulated does not mean that that owner operators and drivers should have their constitutional rights violated. Bottom line is the ELD should not be a one size fits all. If a member of the ATA wants an ELD in their truck(s) than so be it. If a owner operator doesn't, then he/she should not be required to do so, period. In my option the HOS needs to be revamped with the ability to stop and start the clock.

A major burden on transportation in the United States is failure to align regulatory standards with other well-developed regulatory systems, requiring public bodies in the United States to pay higher prices for customized versions of (say) trains that can be purchased off-the-shelf in Europe. I strongly urge DOT to adopt a regulations allowing regulated parties to satisfy U.S. regulations by demonstrating compliance with well-respected foreign regulations such as those in Canada, Europe, or Japan.

2. Environmental reviews are essential, but significantly delay projects. I urge the Department to investigate how to simplify the environmental process. In particular, the Department should strongly consider promulgating regulations or requesting legislation to prevent litigation over environmental studies from derailing projects by allowing payment of mitigation fees in lieu of vacating an approval due to technical defects in environmental studies.

3. The cost of rail and other public transportation projects is significantly increased by regulations that treat brief delays of private vehicles as significant impacts, requiring extensive studies and costly mitigation spending. California recently reformed its state environmental review law, CEQA, to use alternative measures such as Vehicle Miles Traveled in lieu of traditional Level of Service measures. FRA and FTA should consider adopting similar regulatory reforms, so that environmental studies truly measure mobility regardless of mode and do not impose unnecessary mitigation requirements.

4. Many countries have embraced automatic or one-person train operation on passenger rail or mass transit lines. The United States should do the same.

5. The Department should exercise a more common-sense approach to categorization of passenger rail systems as subject to either FRA or FTA regulation. For example, the PATH train system in New Jersey and New York is inexplicably subject to burdensome FRA regulation, despite being very similar to the New York City Subway, which is under FTA regulation. Indeed, the risk of triggering FRA regulation has prevented a number of transit projects in the New York area.

6. Poorly-designed paratransit regulations impose significant cost burdens. The Department should adopt regulations to clarify that a transit operator required to maintain paratransit operations may satisfy its duties by retaining commercial operators such as Uber or Lyft.

I do not think the parties who have the responsibility of research have any understanding of the depth of the mistake that is being made with this rule! I will attempt to explain it so everyone can understand .Way back in history there was a LARGE trucking company, for a multitude of reasons, mostly financial , became a real safety concern to the DOT, and congress, so they but all their legal beagles to work, and after millions of $ of research, and litigation, they decided they needed some help from some out source Company. So ,after much more research and development of resources the came upon a small startup in San Diego , Ca. called Qualcomm ..This was a real live TECH think tank, doing work for the military, NASA and every other industry they could promote a niche in.! The first monitoring mobile, system, and very smart for a bunch of geeks. They had the forethought to maintain the very cherry of their endeavor, every bit of text came back to them and only them ! The demanded that in writing from their own government, and that bunch of clowns, who were so eager to take Warner to task, and get the public off their ass, they said sure no problem ! All the while the boys were celebrating, for they new they had just struck gold.!! First order of business was to throw together some tracking and info units, from units they already had licence for from NASA and Boeing, for transponders and engine management consoles, and get them loaded up on the offending fleet of commercial trucks.. Qualcomm, hit probably the best lick any company could, because they had Warner on the hook for the cost of the prototype mobile units and the base system at Warner's headquarters and Qualcomm home offices. In short order they knew what their start up costs were so they did some projections ,and set up a leasing agreement on all their equipment, WA LA.a home run!!!  As time goes by General Motors, Ford Motors and every large trucking company in the US Become rental customers for Qualcomm, by now they have become huge in the the Transportation Industry of America, and on WALL STREET..Here is were things start getting strange, a lot of influence in the transportation industry, all facets of it, a lot of contact with people of influence, DOT sees a why to make things easier for themselves , and gain some favor with some certain congressional types , low and behold they create a problem in the trucking industry,, any way getting of topic here so, A while back FMCSA comes up with this ELD system they have dreamed up that is going to fix every thing!  As usual , no one did much research beyond the concept, which has its merits, but is still flawed. The concept originally centered around the fact, that a law enforcement officer, or a public safety officer would be required to physically plug in to a receptacle on the vehicle to download the information from the unit, makes good sense, and about the same coverage they have presently.. Well, Guess what that does not gain Qualcomm , one iota of business, and this was their idea, I can hear the phones humming still, and all the COP Unions said hell no, this is not any better than it is now !!! Still one entity here is not being addressed at all .here it is in a nut shell, The computer controls on these trucks are doing what they designed to do, record and store data, the problem that is being introduced into the equation is now you, THE FMCSA, are going to jeopardise, not only the trucks security, but also the drivers personal  information, and also his personal financial information, by allowing an outside electronic monitor to search and down load information, indiscriminately from that truck REMEMBER all new CREDIT CARDS have chips embedded that can be remotely accessed !!!  Last but not least, there are automated repeater systems on the market today for approximately$150.00,with $50.00, of modification will do everything that these so called ELD boxes will .

The NRC is opposed to the creation of the pilot program and the associated proposed rule.

The NRC is the trade association organized specifically to serve the needs of rail construction and maintenance contractors and suppliers. The NRCs approximately 400 member companies are involved in the construction and maintenance of the nations rail and transit systems. NRC member companies employ over 30,000 people directly working in the rail contracting and supply business nationwide and take in over $10 billion in annual revenue. NRC member companies perform rail construction and maintenance work for 28 commuter rail systems, 33 light rail systems, and 15 heavy rail systems, in addition to hundreds of freight railroads, port facilities, military facilities, and industrial freight rail track owners.

"59","DOT",FALSE,1,NA,"2011-09-19T00:00:00-04:00","Accessibility of air travel continues to be an important public policy objective but does not permit defective and misleading economic analysis. It is reasonable for DOT to phase in standards for website accessibility while minimizing industry compliance cost.  We recommend that DOT limit the scope of Level AA compliance to the pages associated with booking, managing or changing a reservation and provide a minimum two-year window for implementation prior to the first effective date.  But DOT’s proposed changes for airport kiosk accessibility are unreasonable and unjustified. 14 CFR 382.57 requires airlines to offer individuals with disabilities priority “front of the line” access to check-in counters and agents, and DOT has documented no failures that necessitate further regulatory action.  Its proposed solution (full kiosk accessibility) raises important safety and welfare questions for the general public.  

Our comments focus on six problems with the SNPRM.  First, policies that drive consumers to online/kiosk transactions will result in loss of airline jobs.  Second, there are inherent safety considerations for all passengers related to fully automated check-in by individuals with visual disabilities.  Third, website and kiosk use by individuals with visual disabilities may be slower than interaction with a call center or airport desk.  Fourth, fundamental errors in the supplied Preliminary Regulatory Analysis result in overstated benefits and understated costs.  Fifth, implementation timetables proposed are unrealistically short.  Sixth, it is impractical to hold airlines liable for accessibility of independent agency websites, or to jointly and severally penalize airlines and airports for common-use kiosks.

However, after reading a number of the open comments I believe that banning peanuts on flights or flights containing person(s) aboard with these allergies will be very difficult at best.  If a proposed ban on peanuts is passed it will create a whole new category of goods that the TSA agents will now have to look for;  peanuts, peanut butter products and any other product that has peanut oil or nuts in their ingredients.  If someone is going to bring them on board for a snack there is no guarantee that any particular passenger will voluntarily give up those products or not eat them during flight.  These items cannot be detected or identified by x-ray or other currently used TSA devices.  I see a real potential for litigation against those that brought/ate them on board or for the peanut dust left behind by the last passenger assigned to that seat.  There are language barriers and many other reasons why someone didn't think or comply that such a ban.  As a frequent flier,  I would not support such a ban, other than what the airlines already do to help accommodate passengers with this allergy.","DOT-OST-2010-0140","Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections","Rulemaking","DOT-OST-2010-0140-0857","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2010-07-12T00:00:00-04:00","Jesse Fuller","Jesse David Fuller",NA,NA,"Not Assigned"

The current low PNW threshold often drives the disadvantaged owners of DBE firms to make economic decisions based on DBE status retention rather than other, more conventional, market drivers.  For example, the exclusion of the business firm itself from the PNW calculation results in some DBE owners causing value to accumulate within the business rather than distributing it to the owners.  This can result in accumulated earnings tax issues, increases in litigation exposure, and so forth.

I also support the exclusion of qualified retirement accounts from the calculation of the PNW cap.  Funds in qualified retirement accounts, while perhaps liquid, are not easily liquidated and available for the use of the DBE business without tax penalties.  For this reason exclusion from the calculation is warranted.

Finally, I also endorse an additional rule change that would cause the PNW cap to be revisited every year and adjusted based upon the CPI-U.  At a minimum this should be done every few years – not every twenty.

Thank you for considering these views.","DOT-OST-2010-0118","Disadvantaged Business Enterprise: Program Improvements","Rulemaking","DOT-OST-2010-0118-0087","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2010-07-09T00:00:00-04:00","William Cotter","William J. Cotter",NA,NA,"2105-AD75"

We are writing to support certain aspects of the proposed rulemaking that would amend 49 CFR Part 26 (Docket No. OST-2010-0118).

In particular, we strongly support the proposed adjustment to the personal net worth (PNW) test under consideration that would revise the PNW cap from $750,000 to $1.31 million (49 CFR 26.67).  We have found that the unadjusted PNW cap has driven some of our clients to make economic decisions that are not always in the best interests of the DBE firm, or in the best interests of the qualifying DBE owner.   

For example, historically the value of the DBE firm itself and the personal residence of the qualifying DBE owner have been excluded from the PNW calculation.   We are aware that in order to continue to meet the unrealistically low PNW cap some DBE firms have built up value within the DBE firm itself instead of distributing that wealth to the qualifying DBE owner because that wealth would be “charged against” his or her PNW cap.  Often this accumulation of value within a DBE firm leaves the firm vulnerable to other problems, such as accumulated earnings tax, being targeted for litigation, and so forth.

Similarly, we are aware of qualifying DBE owners who have acquired personal residences of more significant value that they might otherwise have acquired – simply because its value would not be “charged against” the PNW calculation.

In short, we see the low PNW cap as influencing DBE firms and their owners to make economic decisions based on typical market factors rather than being driven by an artificially low PNW cap.

We also endorse  the exclusion from the PNW calculation of the qualifying DBE owner’s qualified retirement accounts such 401k accounts, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), Roth IRAs, Keough plans, SEP plans and similar tax deferred accounts.  Funds contained in such accounts cannot be acce","DOT-OST-2010-0118","Disadvantaged Business Enterprise: Program Improvements","Rulemaking","DOT-OST-2010-0118-0065","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2010-07-08T00:00:00-04:00","William Cotter","William J.

(1) Banning the serving of peanuts and 
all peanut products by both U.S. and foreign carriers on flights 
covered by DOT's disability rule;

My 4-year old son and my 7-year old nephew both have life-threatening peanut allergies.  Both me and my sister carry Epinephrine.  My sister's son has had several severe reactions so far.  For children/people this sensitive, it takes only physical contact (by touching peanut oil on seats & surrounding area, or breathing air containing peanut particulate) to cause a severe reaction.  I have avoided flying with my son for this reason.  

I have a a friend who traveled on a flight that provided a peanut-free zone voluntarily, but because the seats contained previous passengers who ate peanuts, or because the peanut particulate was traveling throughout the cabin her son's airway closed up and his face swollen.  She was lucky, there was a doctor on board who helped her out, she gave the epinephrine, and her son's airway opened again.  

With so many other options for in-flight snacks, it seems ridiculous to me that airlines would even choose to serve something that an increasing number of children are severely allergic to.

I believe that the revised regulations governing Psychiatric Service Animals unfairly discriminates against people with psychiatric disabilities. Most psychiatric disabilities, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), are by nature a hidden disability, unlike more apparent physical disabilities that can be seen with the naked eye. The requirements spelled out in Section 382.117(e) are discriminatory for people with hidden disabilities versus people with physical disabilities, thereby treating one class of disabled passengers differently than other classes of disabled passengers, as well as their nondisabled counterparts. The requirement also imposes on passengers with psychiatric disabilities new time restrictions, added expenses and potentially embarrassing situations with airport and airline staff that forces them to reveal the nature of their hidden disability - which also raises significant privacy concerns. The DOT requirements should also have input from the various airlines that have to implement these rules, because the end result will most certainly be legal litigation aimed at the Airline Industry and DOT. Furthermore, since no data exists to document that a problem exists whereby passengers without disabilities are trying to ""pass off pets as service animals, DOT's requirement is punishing the very passengers that it is intended to protect under the law. It appears that the more prudent approach would involve DOT working with input from the airlines - and advocacy groups - on data collection to ascertain whether widespread misuse and violations of the protections by non-disabled passengers exists before imposing an added barrier to passengers needing Psychiatric Service Animals.","DOT-OST-2009-0093","Psychiatric Service Dog Society - Petition for Rulemaking - Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel ","Nonrulemaking","DOT-OST-2009-0093-0127","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2009-12-09T00:00:00-05:00","Robert Hanafin","Robert Leroy Hanafin","Veterans Today News Network",NA,NA

Equate the Service dog to the need for a person to take tranquilizers or sedatives. Or even a person suffering from a heart condition. Should those persons be required to be drug free and not have medication available on the flight? 

The right of a person to be accompanied by a service animal must be applied equally and can not be restricted to just the visible disability. That right to be accompanied by a service animal must be applied equally to all persons with a disability.

RE: DBE Program; Potential Program Improvements 
       Docket No OST-20009 
       Agency: Office of the Secretary, DOT

Dear Mr. LaHood, 

Thank for the opportunity to provide comment on the proposed rulemaking
regarding 49 CFR Part 26. As an attorney, I have represented small, socially and
economically disadvantaged businesses seeking participation as a DBE in
federally-assisted contracts in all but two of our nation’s states. Thus, I have
developed a great deal of practical experience and knowledge of the
administration of Part 26 and its effectiveness at leveling the competitive
playing field for DBEs seeking participation in such contracts.	

PROPERLY EMPHASIZE PART 26 OBJECTIVES REGARDING INCREASED DBE COMPETITIVENESS 

While the Objectives of Part 26 include ensuring that only qualified DBEs are
certified for participation in this program, the program’s written objectives
place much more emphasis on increasing a DBE’s ability and opportunity to
compete for federally-assisted contracts. In practice, however, recipients
throughout the nation place the largest amount of their resources on the
certification objective, with post-contract-award compliance enforcement drawing
the second largest share of a program’s energies. The “playing field”—or RFP
solicitation and pre-award competitive process, is largely ignored. Given this
context, it is not surprising that there are no studies that present a
statistically significant improvement in the competitiveness of DBEs for
DOT/FAA-assisted contracts, much less any study that concludes that any
improvement can be directly attributed to the implementation of Part 26.

In terms of competition for the award of a contract, the only real DBE program
mechanism designed to effect the “playing field” is the program’s monitoring of
a Prime’s “good faith effort” in complying with the contract’s “DBE
Participation Goal”. However, Primes and program administrators throughout the
nation engage in a myriad of practices that result in the appearance of
compliance with Part 26 regulations, but that, in substance, circumvent the
intent of the program and regulations. 

Some of those practices, as engaged in by Primes, include:

1)	Submitting “Good Faith Certification” forms which fail to list all DBEs that
presented themselves to the Prime as Ready, Willing, and Able (RWA) DBEs for the
project. Thus, when a DBE program administrator contacts the DBE’s on the Good
Faith Certification form, the administrator is never made aware of other DBEs
that expressed to that Prime its interest in participating in the project/contract.
2)	Engaging in negotiations with, and obtaining commitments from, DBE firms even
though its (the Prime’s) intent is to submit a Proposal with a “Good Faith”
waiver request, and with the intent of submitting a proposal that omits the
committed DBE.
3)	Sending “blast” solicitations of participation to DBE’s whose business is in
no way related to the subject matter of the project.
4)	Rejecting interested DBEs on the grounds that:
a)	“The DBE is redundant to the team”—i.e. that the Prime will go with a NON-DBE
to obtain the services or materials provided by the DBE. This justification is a
blatant rejection of the overall intent of Part 26, and, ergo, ought to be a
presumption of non-compliance with Part 26;
b)	“The selection committee will only count black-owned DBEs towards the DBE
participation goal.” This reason is given even where no properly-supported
race-specific goal has been created, as in the City of Birmingham;
c)	“The selection committee will only count local DBE’s towards the DBE
participation goal.” This reasoning is farcical given that projects which
trigger DBE program requirements are usually sought after by Primes and DBEs
from across the region, and even from across the nation; and
d)	“The RFP mandates consideration of only DBEs that are on the local DBE
list.”This justification is given even where the RFP clearly allows for
out-of-state DBE participation in the contract (which, by the way, is allowed on
most of the RFPs that I have read).
 
These types of practices are common throughout the industry, and are used to
such an extent that Primes everywhere are engaging in conduct that strongly
suggests that they consider compliance with DBE program requirements, especially
at the contract competition phase, as an optional rule of play on this playing
field. 

Thus, it is critical to the substantive implementation of Part 26 that DBE
programs close these gaps by either requiring the Prime to pull DBEs from a
national list of DBEs or by maintaining a reporting mechanism whereby all DBEs
can learn of RFPs and all interested DBEs can register their interest in
participating in any given project, or by requiring both activities. By
requiring both, a DBE compliance officer can refer to the “Interest
Registration” list to use in the verification of a Prime’s good faith efforts,
and Primes will be less able to avoid real compliance with Part 26. 

RECOGNIZE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PLAYING FIELD IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF PART 26

Please also consider the following situational factors that contribute to
reducing the effectiveness of Part 26 in achieving its “playing field” objectives:

1)	Participants in federally-assisted contracts come from a regional and a
national pool of contractors and sub-contractors. Yet, DBE programs base their
disparity studies and “market area” on a much smaller geographic area. This
basis, and the recipient’s resulting “pool” of DBEs, falls egregiously short of
a real or accurate reflection of the actual playing field for these contracts.
To compound the problem, project administrators occasionally require a currently
certified out-of-state DBE to be “in-state” certified before the RFP submittal
deadline. These practices demonstrate that being a certified DBE hardly gets the
disadvantaged business unto the playing field, much less able to move about it
with the other competitors.
2)	Primes are usually large firms that also often have internal marketing
departments with teams of 10, 20, or more individuals to prepare proposals.
Truly small, socially and economically disadvantaged businesses do not have such
resources, and often cannot afford to allocate staff to the writing of
proposals, even though they are competent to deliver on the project. Currently,
I know of no recipient that addresses this situation.
3)	Often Primes further restrict the DBE’s competitiveness by requiring the DBE
to commit exclusively to that Prime and/or prohibit the DBE from participating
in any other Prime’s team. 
4)	Project administrators do not, as an industry practice, allow DBE
sub-contractors to compete independently from non-DBE Primes for portions of a
federally-assisted contract. Further, it is unrealistic for a DBE—especially a
professional services DBE, to spontaneously indicate their interest in a project
by submitting a proposal or cost estimate to a Prime, as the DBE will not be
privy to the Prime’s approach to the project and to the Prime’s intended scope
of work for any necessary team members. Here again, the DBE is ineffective as a
real competitor for any portion of the federally-assisted contract.
5)	Large Non-DBE Primes do not compete for the federally-assisted contracts that
are too small to trigger compliance with Part 26. Yet, project administrators
are not required to consider DBEs participation for these contracts, even though
many DBEs would appreciate increased opportunity to compete for them.

In order give substance to the implementation of Part 26, DBE program
administrators must routinely survey and educate themselves as to the practices
occurring during the RFP process, and must use that information to develop
initiatives that are narrowly tailored to achieve the Part 26 objectives
regarding DBEs’ competitiveness and opportunities.

REQUIRE CERTIFICATION VIA RECIPROCITY

The current practice by ALL recipients of refusing to recognize out-of-state
DBEs imposes an unfair and excessive burden on socially and economically
disadvantaged businesses, and unreasonably restricts the DBEs ability to compete
for any federally-assisted contract in which it is RWA to participate. This
situation must be corrected.

A survey of my own DBE clients demonstrates that Part 26 has done little to
strengthen DBEs’ competiveness for federally-assisted contracts. In fact,
participation in the DBE presents as an unjustifiable cost to the economically
disadvantaged business. I found that, on average, my DBE clients spent $1.80 to
be awarded $1.00 as a DBE on federally-assisted contracts. The survey also
demonstrates that my DBE clients spent an average of 8.5 hours completing the
certification application (excluding site-visit), and an average of $600 in
incidental costs to prepare and submit the application. 

Given that transportation construction projects are not the type to repeat
themselves frequently, contractors and DBEs whose mainstay is transportation
construction must seek work across a wide geographic range. However, even though
the CFR’s allow for certification via reciprocity, only two states in fifty have
offered even a truncated certification process. Not one state offers
certification via reciprocity. Thus, a DBE must submit complete certification
applications to many recipients if it wants to be considered as a DBE
participant for transportation projects occurring throughout its own market area.

This situation is untenable and undermines the entire DBE program. 

Its continued existence is made even more egregious given that the certification
process and form is narrowly prescribed by Part 26 and that recipients are
mandated not to stray from the process or the form. That recipients are allowed
to claim a general distrust of other recipients’ certification process is
unreasonable and shoves the burden of the program on the very entities the
program is designed to benefit: socially and economically disadvantaged businesses.

Certification via reciprocity should be the rule. Further, once certified under
a Part 23 or Part 26 administered program, the DBE should be listed as a
properly certified DBE throughout the nation. It should then be the
responsibility of the recipient to demonstrate cause for requiring submittal of
an application from a properly certified DBE. 

DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT, AND MONITOR A STRONGER OVERSIGHT PROGRAM FOR NON-PRIMARY
RECIPIENTS

Currently, Non-Primary Recipients number in the hundreds once municipalities and
regional transportation organizations are tallied. Yet, even though these
entities are required to comply with Part 26, I rarely find that such a
recipient has substantively met the requirements of the Part. Almost every
recipient-municipality or recipient-regional transportation entity that I have
encountered has either deviated grossly from the Parts’ requirements and
objectives, or has simply wholly failed to meet them. 

Further, it is not uncommon for such a recipient to issue an RFP, yet to make no
information available regarding their DBE program, its staff, its policies, or
its monitoring and enforcement strategies. A recipient’s failure to publish or
to provide public access to any DBE program statements, mechanisms, etc. renders
the recipient’s participation goals easily ignored or manipulated by Primes and
even by project managers, as happened recently in the City of Birmingham.
Further, when the recipient does not advertise information on how, or to whom,
to present concerns about their DBE program, the contract award process, etc.,
this leaves the concerned party with little recourse other than to pursue a
formal complaint or litigation to resolve what may be best resolved informally.
Unfortunately, it is also not uncommon for federal offices that are responsible
for oversight of these recipients to be completely unaware of the recipient’s
non-compliance.

Thus, a comprehensive oversight or auditing program of Non-Primary Recipients’
DBE Program would be instrumental in providing information to recipient DBE
program administrators. Further, every recipient that issues a RFP should be
required to coincidentally publish the entirety of their DBE program policies
and enforcement mechanisms, as well as the contact information for the office or
personnel responsible for processing concerns and complaints, whether formal or
informal. Failure to do so should trigger a timely audit and imposition of
appropriate adjustments.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS

For the following reasons, current administrative policies and procedures
greatly reduce Part 26’s effectiveness at creating opportunities for DBE
participation in federally-assisted contracts, and impose significant undue
burdens on DBE’s seeking participation in the Part 26 program. 

First, DOT civil rights officers and DBE program administrators across the
country place the majority of their programs’ energies on the certification
process. This practice is at the expense of developing, implementing, and
monitoring policies and procedures which provide substance to Part 26’s other
objectives, especially those intent on leveling the “competitive” playing field
and creating opportunities for DBE involvement in federally-assisted contracts. 

Second, because DBE programs, policies, and administrators fail to implement and
monitor substantive programs aimed at the RFP solicitation process,
non-disadvantaged firms continue to engage in a myriad of techniques that
circumvent DBE participation goals and render the program without substance.

Third, DBE program administrators across the country deviate from the intent and
letter of Part 26’s certification procedures and form. Part 26 creates a
narrowly-tailored certification process that requires use of a specific form.
However, most recipients claim that others’ certification process is so
deficient that they require the DBE to “re-apply” by submitting an entirely new
application. Recognition of Part 26’s focus on uniformity of process and on
assistance to the DBE is obliterated by the failure of every single recipient to
offer certification via reciprocity. 

Fourth, DOT Civil Rights Regional offices have not published nor implemented an
oversight policy or program that specifically regulates the DBE programs of the
hundreds of Non-Primary Recipients of federal transportation monies. These
Non-Primary Recipients are often municipalities or regional transportation
bodies that are also required to comply with Part 26. However, the large
majority of these recipients that I have encountered fail the requirements, and
the objectives, of Part 26, in any number of ways. Further, it is extremely
difficult to find the recipients’ DBE program material or officers’ contact
information, and the intent of Part 26 is often subverted into serving the
recipient’s unique agenda. Thus, Part 26 is rendered without substance in a
large number of areas throughout the country.

To address these concerns, please consider the following broadly described
changes to the administration of Part 26:
1)	Adjust administrative emphases to better encompass all stated objectives of
the programs, giving more balanced attention to the objectives of;
		a) ensuring “nondiscrimination in the award and administration of
                                  DOT- assisted contracts”(§26.1(a)); 
		b) creating “a level playing field on which DBEs can compete fairly for
                                 DOT-assisted contracts” (§26.1(b)); and
		c) removing “barriers to the participation of DBEs in DOT-assisted 		         
                                  contracts”(§26.1(e)).
2)	realize and incorporate a thorough understanding of actual competitive
practices into DBE programs’ enforcement and monitoring procedures;
3)	Require all recipients to honor another recipient’s certification—i.e. for
all DBEs that were properly certified by their home-state, presume certification
via reciprocity is the appropriate path for certification by all other
recipients or DBE programs; and
4)       Implement a comprehensive and public auditing program regarding Non-Primary
Recipients’ DBE programs (such as those required of municipalities and regional
transportation organizations), and make information gleaned from the audits
available to all DBEs and DBE program administrators throughout the country.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, my experience with Part 26 leads me to conclude that oversight of
this program must occur under the philosophy that the program’s ultimate
objective is not to define the players or to effect the people, but to effect
the process.

My name is John Fox and I'm writing on behalf of the Seattle Displacement 
Coalition, a 30 year community advocacy organization here in Seattle to comment 
on grant criteria for supplement discretionary grants for capital investments in 
Surface Transportation Infrastructure.  I'm also writing on behalf of a larger 
coalition of over 16 community, small business, and democratic party 
organizations and over 100 community leaders opposed to the use of federal 
stimulus monies (TIGER funds in this case) for Seattle's Mercer Corridor Project.  

Already the Mercer Corridor project is 100 million dollars over original cost 
projections and the City is simply seeking to alter criteria you use for granting 
these funds so they can secure these funds to cover cost overruns.  The Mercer 
Corridor Project also does not meet a real transportation need in Seattle and will 
actually make traffic congestion worse in the Eastbound Direction. The project is 
located in Seattle's South Lake Union - it is home to developer Paul Allen's plans 
for a biotech hub in this area - and merely serves as a beautification project to 
enhance land values in this growing area.  I've attached a letter identifying coalition 
members opposed to this project.

The City of Seattle will be seeking 50 million of TIGER funding for this project and 
it does not meet grant criteria for receipt of these funds.  

Regarding criteria for use of these stimulus funds, economic recovery monies 
must serve a purpose in this case a real transportation purpose which this 
application does not but most important of all, these funds are designated 
for ""economically distressed areas"". We want to emphasize that this must remain 
the highest priority and key criteria for use of these stimulus monies. 

In order to skirt this key requirement, and you may check the Seattle City Council 
record Monday June 1st 930 AM Council Briefing, our City has asked you to de-
elevate the importance of this criteria and instead give priority to ""economically 
growing areas"".  This is a clear attempt to skirt the key criteria and direct funds 
precisely where they are not needed in Seattle and for a project that will do 
nothing to reduce traffic congestion in our city as indicated by 3 independent and 
even city sponsored studies.  It's simply a beautification project serving one large 
development company and aimed at moving traffic away from his key waterfront 
properties.  Already, the State Legislature decided not to provide stimulus funding 
for the Mercer project precisely because it did not meet recovery act criteria.

In Seattle there are an identified 30 bridges in critical need of repair - many of 
them located in parts of SE and SW Seattle - truly low income and distressed 
areas.  This does not include a backlog of over one-half billion in road and street 
and sidewalk improvements mostly in these distressed communities. Yet our city 
will forgo seeking stimulus monies for these projects in favor of a 50 million dollar 
request for Mercer - primarily to serve the developer agenda of one man - Paul 
Allen - and his development company Vulcan Inc.  

We urge you to retain as your most important criteria for use of these funds - 
economically distressed communities. It would be a breach of the voters faith and 
the recovery act to do otherwise. Only these communities deserve these funds. 
Sadly our city doesn't seem to care and would abuse this program.  They are 
seeking to have you change criteria that would undercut the intent of these 
recovery funds.

Also see following letter providing more detail as to why no stimulus funds should 
be used for the Mercer Corridor Project.  Instead of meeting current proposed 
criteria, the city is seeking to alter the criteria to move it's application up as 
priority - here is our letter submitted to oppose use of stimulus funds to local 
officials:

Organizations and Community Leaders Opposed to Use of Stimulus Funds for 
Seattle’s Mercer Corridor Project

March 12, 2009

The Honorable Julia Patterson, Chair
Transportation Policy Board 
Puget Sound Regional Council
1011 Western Avenue 
Seattle, WA 98104

Dear Ms. Patterson:

As residents and community leaders from across Seattle, we are writing to 
strongly urge you to deny the City's $80 million dollar request for federal dollars for 
the ""Mercer Corridor Project"".  The City has submitted this request for at least 
that amount in federal funds drawn from the stimulus package now being initiated 
by the President Elect Obama. Our mayor is seeking these funds to fill a growing 
funding gap given that project costs have skyrocketed from $90 million four years 
ago to over $200 million today.

Earmarking monies for the Mercer project would represent a gross misuse of 
stimulus package dollars given that this plan does not address either a regional or 
local transportation need in our community. Under the Mayor's plan, Mercer would 
be widened and turned into a 2-way tree-lined boulevard where it runs through the 
South Lake Union Neighborhood between I-5 and the Seattle Center. Valley Street 
that now absorbs much of the westbound traffic from I-5 would be narrowed with 
that traffic funneled onto Mercer.  

City Council staff and the City's Department of Transportation (SDOT) have 
acknowledged that these costly changes will do absolutely nothing to reduce 
traffic congestion along that corridor and will at certain intersections make it 
worse. In fact, there are at least three studies now that have been done which 
confirm that this preferred two-way Mercer plan will exacerbate traffic problems in 
South Lake Union.  One study done as part of the preliminary environmental 
review cites delays of traffic by as much as 7-18 minutes in the eastbound 
direction if this plan is implemented. 

The Mayor's planners also have tried to argue that reconfiguring Mercer will help 
move traffic through downtown during State Route 99 and Alaskan Way Viaduct 
construction.  According to the City Council’s analysis, no research shows that 
the proposed changes will in any way alleviate congestion during this construction.

By contrast, in 2000, there was a plan preferred by the community and by our 
former Mayor Paul Schell that was called the ""small and simple"" fix which, if 
implemented, would have cost only $10 million (in 2000 dollars). That plan also 
would have done more to reduce congestion in the area, but it was dropped from 
consideration after our current Mayor took office and after the City sold all the 
properties along Mercer to billionaire Paul Allen.  
Put simply, today’s Mercer two-way alternative is a 'pork barrel' project that was 
devised to mesh with redevelopment plans now occurring in South Lake Union 
where Mercer is located. That plan is driven by Paul Allen's Vulcan development 
company which owns nearly 50% of all developable land in that area and 
especially along Mercer and Valley streets. The Mercer project is designed to 
redirect traffic away from Paul Allen's view properties located along Valley street 
closest to the lake and push it all on to Mercer - at a cost of over 200 million 
dollars (and climbing).  Paul Allen will also benefit when the City buys back land 
along Mercer he owns - now very expensive land the City sold to him only seven 
years ago at rock bottom prices.

This is precisely the kind of project the Obama administration has said they would 
not support for use of stimulus package dollars.  It also would be the wrong first 
step for the incoming administration to take, especially when there are so many 
real pressing transportation needs in our region with a price tag of over 15 billion 
dollars, including nearly a one billion dollar backlog of critical road, sidewalk, and 
bridge repairs in our city's neighborhoods.  These are the kinds of projects that 
desperately need these stimulus funds not the Mercer project. 

City engineers have identified 33 bridges in our neighborhoods in serious need of 
repair, some bordering on unsafe.  To preference Mercer over these needs strikes 
us as a serious breach of the voters' trust. These are projects that have been 
waiting years for promised dollars and meet the president elect's most important 
criteria for receipt of stimulus funds - they are shovel ready, i.e., ready for 
immediate start-up. By contrast, the Mercer Project faces months if not years of 
extensive environmental review and likely litigation due to community opposition. 

It's time to pull the plug on the Mercer project. Some of the constituent and 
neighborhood groups directly affected by the two-way Mercer plan that already 
have gone on record opposing it include:

Subject:	Comments of Aviation Consumer Action Project on NPRM
“Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections”

Reference:	14 CFR Parts 234, 253, 259, and 399
Docket No. DOT-OST-2007-0022
RIN No. 2105-AD72

SUBJECT:	The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) opposes the subject 
NPRM (Item 1) as an unlawful delegation of DOT authority and responsibility to 
regulate airlines in the public interest by delegating this function the airlines 
themselves.  As written it is an anti-consumer regulation that would take away 
existing common law tort rights of airline passengers for false imprisonment and 
negligence in situations of long confinements on the tarmac of 3-11 hours, that 
airlines now subject approximately 300,000 passengers a year to, and substitute 
an unenforceable contract cause of action.  ACAP supports Items 2-7 of the 
NPRM. 


Dear Secretary LaHood:

	The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) was founded in 1971 as 
501(c ) 3 nonprofit organization that acts as voice for air travelers on issues of 
safety, security and airline consumer rights and interests.  It has held 
longstanding membership on the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee 
(ARAC) and the Aviation Security Advisory Committee.  We have testified before 
Congress on the issues in this NPRM and filed comments with DOT.  

	I have been executive director of ACAP since 1997 and as an attorney 
have represented ACAP, individual consumers and Flyersrights.org (fka the 
Coalition for an Airline Passengers Bill of Rights) in the federal and state courts on 
the issues addressed in this NRPM.

1.  Putting Contingency Plans in the Contract of Carriage.

	This NPRM (1) is a last gasp Bush Administration/Airline Industry effort 
to turn over DOT regulatory authority to the regulated party.  It would lead to a 
multiplicity of unenforceable “standards” and “plans.”  Some airlines already are 
using a 4 to 6 hour guideline for tarmac confinements.  As there is presently no 
federal standard, state common law standards for negligence and false 
imprisonment, state criminal statutes involving unsafe operation of aircraft and 
wrongful imprisonment or reckless endangerment, and possibly constitutional 
protections against unreasonable seizure are the only legal protections airline 
passengers have against indefinite tarmac confinements.  

	Most airlines now have or claim to have contingency plans to deal with 
flight disruptions of more than 2 hours.  But they are vague and commonly ignored 
(e.g. American Airlines has a contingency plan that is supposed to be activated 
after a 2 hours of delay but it was been found by the OIG to have been ignored and 
violated repeatedly in a Sept. 2007 report of its 12/29/06 mass diversion and 
stranding of over 100 flights involving over 10,000 passengers).  Such plans are 
vague and there is nothing in them that a airline passenger can really enforce in a 
contract action.  Such plans placed in the contract of carriage would just be 
another way for airlines to absolve themselves of responsibility for long tarmac 
delays, diversions and confinements.

	These confinements of 3- 11 hours now affect approximately 300,000 
passengers per year and have led to a national outcry and the formation of a 
national grass roots organization, Flyersrights.org with over 24,000 members.  The 
claims of the Air Transport Association that tarmac confinements have declined 
are false or at least unproven.  The DOT BTS only recently began collecting these 
statistics in 2008 and has had to remove the data presented by the airlines 
as “corrupted” and therefore unreliable.

	The proposed regulation would wipe out existing legal protections and 
in our view would lead to more not less tarmac confinements as each airline would 
be in effect be able to write its own rule.  Such an unlawful delegation of DOT 
regulatory authority  would no doubt be challenged in court.   

	The age of self-regulation and deregulation whether in the financial 
industry, air safety, food safety, or airline consumer protection is over.  It has been 
thoroughly discredited by scandals and disasters over the past two years and 
even rejected by many of its former advocates.  The Obama DOT must reject the 
mantra of former DOT Secretary Peters that the “market” will solve all consumer 
problems.  Senator and Candidate Obama endorsed airline passenger rights 
legislation that would outlaw tarmac confinements of over 3 hours, which this 
NPRM would clearly not do.  
	
	When an airline passenger brings an action in state court,  the airline 
almost invariably has it removed to federal court on grounds of federal preemption.  
The defendant airline will then file a series of motions to have the case transferred 
to its home state, often far from the consumer passenger’s residence.  The cost of 
such litigation far exceeds the individual claims for ordinary delays or tarmac 
confinements.  The airlines are generally successful in having such lawsuits 
dismissed, discouraged or abandoned.  Indeed a review of cases under CCH 
Aviation cases shows that virtually the only breach of contract cases brought 
under the contracts of carriage successfully involve cargo shipments by 
commercial shippers.   You can view the many technical defenses Recent cases 
involving passenger strandings which include  Ray v American Airlines, Inc. US 
DC WD AR 08-5072, Hanni v American Airlines, Inc. US DC ND CA 08-732; 
Harper v American Airlines, Inc. US DC ND AL 08-________ (filed 12/29/08); 
Biscone v JetBlue Airways Corp., NYS SC Queens Co. 3776/2008.  The motions 
to dismiss or transfer or for summary judgment filed by the airline defendants can 
be viewed online at Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) or the 
electronic dockets of the New York State Uniform Court System web site.

	Under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) (perhaps better 
described as the Consumer Class Action Elimination Act of 2005), nearly all state 
consumer class actions (which involves any case with a potential total claim over 
$5 Million) are removed to federal court where the bar is so high for certification 
that very few consumer class actions have ever been certified since this statute 
went into effect.  In the 5th Circuit which is the home of American, Southwest and 
Continental Airlines, none have been certified.  

	As to the issue of tarmac confinements, only one 1999 case against 
Northwest Airlines has been certified as a class action to our knowledge, and that 
occurred in Michigan state court involving confinements of up to 9 hours of 4,000 
passengers prior to the enactment of CAFA. Only through class actions in federal 
court or in local small claims court is it possible for airline passengers to judicially 
enforce breach of contract to tort claims that do not involve serious physical injury 
or death.  And since a class action requires that many passengers be involved 
with common facts and law, only mass stranding events would normally qualify.

	Some airlines already provide for compensation for delays and 
associated expenses of overnight lodging in their contracts of carriage, but these 
provisions are not as a practical matter enforceable and are frequently ignored or 
avoided entirely by airlines coding nearly every delayed or canceled flight as 
weather or FAA Air Traffic Control related.  There is no effective oversight by DOT 
and no fines of substance for airline violation of their own contracts or customer 
service plans or contingency plans or internal policies, and none seems likely in 
the foreseeable future.

	The NPRM if adopted would mean domestic US airline passengers 
would have rights inferior to those provided to international passengers under the 
Montreal Convention of 1999.  Under Art. 19, passengers may recover damages 
for delay of up to  about $6,400 on a near strict liability basis.  An airline to avoid 
liability has the burden of proving that it took all reasonable steps to avoid the 
delay or that the delay was impossible to avoid.  Damages include compensation 
for inconvenience as well as out of pocket losses and this treaty overrides the 
limitations or exclusions commonly found in domestic airline contracts of carriage, 
which make promises in those contracts largely illusory.  

	Should NPRM (Item 1) be adopted in any form, it should include 
provisions in domestic contracts of carriage a) requiring payment of litigation 
expenses of the passenger should s/he substantially prevail in the lawsuit, b) be 
no less favorable to domestic passengers than international passengers, c) should 
specifically authorize suits in state as well as federal courts, d) authorize class 
actions where appropriate, with the consumer class representative receiving a 
reasonable sum in compensation his time and representational responsibilities of 
the class, payment of class notification expenses by the airline defendant, plus 
treble damages or minimum compensation of  four times the ticket price, and e) 
have a hard 3 hour passenger right to deplane plus delay compensation of $10 per 
minute for on ground confinements over 3 hours. 

	Only with such pro-consumer provisions will airlines have an incentive 
to change their existing practices of ignoring passenger complaints and claims 
with impunity or offering only token compensation such as discount coupons or 
restricted vouchers.


	Items 2-7.  ACAP has long advocated for Truth in Scheduling regulation 
as a first line of defense against congestion delays caused by over scheduling by 
airlines.  These proposed measures are in line with our recommendations and 
would address the No. 1 airline passenger complaint:  flight delays.   As 
scheduling has been decontrolled airlines now have incentives to unrealistically 
schedule flights at popular times for competitive reasons, which in turn leads to 
unnecessary congestion at major choke point airports like NYC and Chicago.  
These regulations should allow consumers to avoid chronically delayed flights, 
should eliminate deceptively scheduled flights, and help relieve congestion delays 
at choke point airports.
 
	We generally support the comments of Flyersrights.org .

	The NPRM if adopted would mean domestic US airline passengers 
would have rights inferior to those provided to international passengers under the 
Montreal Convention of 1999.  Under Art. 19, passengers may recover damages 
for delay of up to  about $6,400 on a near strict liability basis.  An airline to avoid 
liability has the burden of proving that it took all reasonable steps to avoid the 
delay or that the delay was impossible to avoid.  Damages include compensation 
for inconvenience as well as out of pocket losses and this treaty overrides the 
limitations or exclusions commonly found in domestic airline contracts of carriage, 
which make promises in those contracts largely illusory.  

	Should NPRM (Item 1) be adopted in any form, it should include 
provisions in domestic contracts of carriage a) requiring payment of litigation 
expenses of the passenger should s/he substantially prevail in the lawsuit, b) be 
no less favorable to domestic passengers than international passengers, c) should 
specifically authorize suits in state as well as federal courts, d) authorize class 
actions where appropriate, with the consumer class representative receiving a 
reasonable sum in compensation his time and representational responsibilities of 
the class, payment of class notification expenses by the airline defendant, plus 
treble damages or minimum compensation of  four times the ticket price, and e) 
have a hard 3 hour passenger right to deplane plus delay compensation of $10 per 
minute for on ground confinements over 3 hours. 

	Only with such pro-consumer provisions will airlines have an incentive 
to change their existing practices of ignoring passenger complaints and claims 
with impunity or offering only token compensation such as discount coupons or 
restricted vouchers.


	Items 2-7.  ACAP has long advocated for Truth in Scheduling regulation 
as a first line of defense against congestion delays caused by over scheduling by 
airlines.  These proposed measures are in line with our recommendations and 
would address the No. 1 airline passenger complaint:  flight delays.   As 
scheduling has been decontrolled airlines now have incentives to unrealistically 
schedule flights at popular times for competitive reasons, which in turn leads to 
unnecessary congestion at major choke point airports like NYC and Chicago.  
These regulations should allow consumers to avoid chronically delayed flights, 
should eliminate deceptively scheduled flights, and help relieve congestion delays 
at choke point airports.

OST-2007-26829

Our Lake George Steamboat Company offers sightseeing tours every day for six months of each year, with 3 boats whose capacity ranges from roughly 300 to 1000.

We offer the following comments on the proposed rule entitled Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities: Passenger Vessels.

We agree with the comments posted on April 19, 2007 by Tennessee Riverboat.  Our company, too, has always done everything we could in order to accommodate all types of passengers.  I personally also agree and understand, as an Occupational Therapist with over 20 years experience working with neurologically involved clients, that all limitations of function cannot be overcome, especially by a small company with limited resources.  

In the Discussion area, Background:
It is stated that this will apply to vessels with a capacity of over 150 passengers.  Depending upon the age of the passenger boat and its configuration, some of the proposed rules will be very difficult to implement on our boats.


Subpart A, Section 39.3:
Your suggested definition of a common wheelchair is such a device which does not exceed 30 inches in width and 48 inches in length measured two inches above the ground, and does not weigh more than 600 pounds when occupied.
If the common wheelchair as defined above was all we were asked to accommodate, we would be happy.  However, we are seeing more passengers coming in extra wide wheelchairs (which measure more than 30), and in scooters (which weigh more than 600 pounds when occupied).  
We have also had passengers brought on board in reclining wheelchairs or Barco loungers (more than 48 in length when reclined).  Any device more than common wheelchair as defined in your draft, will require that the passenger in the device actually takes up more than one passenger space.  In fact, a reclining wheelchair ends up taking at least 3 additional dining spaces (behind and on the sides).  These additional spaces, we cannot put other paying customers into, and we cannot charge the passenger in the wheeled device.

Subpart B, Section 39.25: 
As a PVO, you must not limit the number of passengers with a disability on your vessel.  
Our boat configuration will not allow unlimited passengers in wheelchairs or scooters in the dining room, as we must factor in emergency access pathways, waitstaff lanes for serving food, etc.  Our table configuration must be changed (extra space provided between the tables, etc.) when we need to accommodate someone in a reclining wheelchair or an extra wide wheelchair.  

Section 39.33:  
As a PVO, you must not require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice of the fact that he or she is traveling on or using a passenger vessel.  
There are specific accommodations for which advance notification is needed in our business.  As above, our tables must be moved to accommodate larger mobility vehicles; our passenger capacity decreases as we accommodate these vehicles (due to boat deck configuration).  If we do not have notification in advance, we may simply not have the ability to change things after other passengers are boarded and seated at their dining tables.  The only table left, once most of the other customers are seated, might be the table that cannot be physically reached by a passenger with a mobility device that requires a wider travel lane, or large turning radius. 
This is not easily understood by the passenger whom we cannot accommodate.  Their travel plans might not allow them to wait until the next cruise, or come back the next day, etc.  

Section 39.37: 
must not require that a passenger with a disability travel with another person as a condition of being provided transportation with the following situations excepted: a) a passenger mentally cannot comprehend safety instructions, b) is unable to assist in his or her own emergency evacuation from the vessel, c) is unable communicate with boat personnel on safety information, or d) is unable to perform personal tasks.  
What if the caregiver for such an individual determines that they are capable of caring for 3 or 4 such passengers, and then one of the passengers requires complete assistance with toileting, leaving the other 2-3 passengers completely unattended?  Are we allowed to require an attendant with each?  If we do not know in advance, how are we to provide crew to be designated as the personal or safety assistant role in such a case?

Section 39.53:  
The requirement for a TTY service on information and reservation services is overly burdensome. Many other technologies are used instead.  People making reservations from home are typically on their computers, and if adaptation for visually impairment or mobility impairment is required, it has already been done.  I think this accommodation is best done at the consumers computer level.

Subpart E: Accessibility of Vessels:
	It concerns us that this section is not thought out prior to some of the other requirements in these proposed rules, as the other requirements clearly deal with accessibility.
	As stated previously, there are certain inherent shape issues with a boat as compared with a square, empty room.  There are also requirements from Coast Guard and other governmental agencies dealing with passenger vessel safety, emergency situations, fire, etc., which must be complied with before a single passenger sets foot on board.

Subpart F, Section 39.83: 
(a) states you must not require such a passenger with a disability [who can readily get on or off a passenger vessel without assistance] to accept assistance from you in getting on or off the vessel.
	The boat company would be the one involved in litigation should a passenger think he or she could disembark safely, contrary to the trained crews determination, and come to harm.
	Yet (b) states that the PVO must promptly provide assistance that ensures that the passenger can get on or off the vessel.
	How is this determination to be made  between the passenger who is not able to get on or off a passenger vessel without assistance and one who can readily get on or off a passenger vessel without assistance?
** Also, the Discussion has comments about emergency situations, but the proposed rules do not.

Section 39.89:  
In the Discussion section, the Department seeks comments on any special accommodations for getting safety information communicated to persons with cognitive disabilities.  As an Occupational Therapist, I think it would be impractical to say any special accommodations should occur beyond what is already done, and what is provided for any member of the general public, or child, or older person.  If the passenger has a cognitive disability of any significance, there should be a caregiver with this passenger, one on one, in order to ensure that passengers safety.

Section 39.9: Service animals.
This is an area of concern, as people do want to bring their pets on board.  If our company is required to take the credible verbal assurances of a passenger with a disability using the animal, we will have problems.  First of all, we cannot ask a person if they are disabled, now we are required to believe their assurances that they need the animal. This could easily turn into a person claiming to need an animal that was indeed only a pet for help with a pretend disability.  How do we accommodate other passengers on that same cruise who have allergies to dog hair, or are terribly afraid of animals?

Subpart G, Section 39.101:  Complaints Resolution officials.
We are a relatively small company with many cruises.  I have many years experience as an Occupational Therapist working with clients with neurological diagnoses (adult and children).  Training to proficiency as described in your Discussion (p.2842), including how to distinguish among the differing abilities of individuals with a disability would be not an easy job.  I think certifying the training or drafting a training curriculum would be quite difficult and, actually, unnecessary.  
Cannot you just recommend minimal common courtesy and sensitivity from both sides: the passenger with a disability and the passenger vessel personnel who make our living by being accommodating to the public (with disabilities or without, old or young, etc.)

One last comment about your Discussion on p. 2842.  
You state that this NPRM does not impose significant costs.  For our situation, it would most definitely have an economic impact, as described previously in the situation of the dining area taken up by extra large wheelchairs, etc.  By these rules, we would not be allowed to know a large number of passengers needing wheelchairs were coming, we would not be allowed to limit the numbers at the same time that we were losing several seats in the effort to accommodate the wheelchair, and we would not be allowed to charge for the seats lost.
You state that the NPRM focuses on prohibiting unnecessary practices, eliminating policies that prevent or inhibit travel by persons with disabilities.  Yet it seems to cover far more than that, and it seems to add an economic burden to those of us who are smaller.
Our company is already accommodating people in the best way we can.  We added wheelchair lifts to two of our boats in order to allow more access (adding one required adding an additional 34 to the center of the boat  not an easy task!).  This was not mandated, we did it to provide service to our customers.  To require more, indeed to require the same sort of accommodation from us as from large corporations running large cruise ships, is overly burdensome.

In your Discussion, p. 2843, the Small Business Administration size standards are mentioned, (i.e., under 500 employees is a small business entity).  This is a good standard for determining that a company doesnt have the resources of a large corporation or cruise line, and therefore should not be subjected to these proposed rules (especially the ones such as Sections 39.25, 39.37, 39.53, and others requiring definite economic outlay in terms of additional employees, handouts to customers, etc.)

RIN 2105-AB87
Transportation for Individuals With Disabilities: Passenger Vessels

I, Barry King, am submitting these comments with regard to the impact of the proposed rule making on the operation of sailing vessels certificated as passenger vessels.  My wife and I own and operate a traditional sailing vessel, the schooner Mary Day, offering week long overnight adventure vacations along remote sections of the Maine coast. 

While I am only one vessel owner I am specifically concerned about the Maine windjammer fleet and other traditional sailing vessels at risk if the rules proposed by this docket are accepted without due regard for the historic nature of these vessels, the adventure learning opportunities they provide, and the role they play in tourism related activities here in the Maine.  While these rules will severely impact Maine based vessels there are dozens of vessels with ties to the Maine sailing and boatbuilding industry that will also be impacted.

While no one in the world of small sailing passenger vessels would chose to discriminate against any one for any reason there are limits placed upon vessel owners and operators of small sailing passenger vessels.  Passenger safety is of paramount importance to any vessel operator.  The Maine windjammer fleet works under the careful scrutiny of the United Sates Coast Guard and maintains a remarkable safety record.  These vessels are all owner/ operated small business entities that rely on the day-to-day careful watch of each vessels captain and crew to maintain a vigilant respect for the variety of people who come aboard to experience an adventure vacation.  The experiences these vessels provide are as far from a cruise ship experience as one can get.  There are no itineraries.  We take our guests to parts of the coast that most visitors ashore can only read about, where islands are still wild, where anchorages are largely unvisited, and where respect for the wonders of our pristine environment can be discovered.  These 14 windjammers range in size from 46 feet to 132 feet and all carry less than 49 passengers on multi-day overnight voyages.  9 of these vessels are National Historic landmarks.  10 of these vessels have no inboard means of propulsion and work to the rhythm of wind and tide.  Life aboard is simple, no cell phones, no computers, no fax machines, and no hair dryers.  Each week is an unpredictable exercise in simplicity and a voyage back in time as much as it is a voyage in the present. 

While this docket clearly defines that all passenger vessels including cruise ships and ferries are subject to the requirements set forth in the ADA, I dont believe the writers of the ADA could have foreseen how dramatically this large piece of legislation could impact this tiny Mom and Pop windjammer fleet.  We are not a form of public transportation.  We provide a discretionary adventure vacation experience with no set itinerary and operate in unpredictable conditions. Many of us carry passengers with disabilities at our discretion, taking into account the particular characteristics of our vessels, the environment in which we operate, and the disabilities of those requesting to be aboard.  To sacrifice this discretionary ability, an authority granted to us and expected of us by the USCG, flies in the face of everything we have ever learned as prudent mariners.  

To say that these vessels can be reconfigured to adapt to passengers with disabilities is also imprudent.  These vessels have been built and rebuilt under careful USCG supervision according to accepted marine practices utilizing time honored traditional techniques.  It is no accident that Maine is where these vessels have survived and where people from around the world come to have new sailing passenger vessels built and rebuilt.  One real threat to our industry lies with the vision that if these rules pass, physical accessibility standards will be adopted requiring the reconfiguration of small sailing passenger vessels and the future construction of historical American watercraft will be all but impossible. The recent multi-million dollar launchings from Maine boat yards of the newly constructed historic vessels Lynx and Godspeed in Rockport would be a thing of the past.  The current multi-million dollar rebuild of the replica vessel Bounty would be gone from the ways at Boothbay.  We need to recognize now that small sailing passenger vessels are a very unique part of the American merchant marine and have very different operating requirements.

Passenger with disabilities come in many varieties and the proposed rules do not clearly define disabilities over which we might have discretion without fear of litigation and for which we will be expected to fit out our vessels and crew.  It is unrealistic to accept the notion that these financially marginal vessels can sacrifice passenger carrying capacity and incur greater operating expenses to accommodate people of all abilities.  Just as human beings have their limits; these vessels have limits as well.  And were it possible to build the perfect small sailing passenger vessel, accessible to all, it would not be a windjammer. The history would be gone. The wildest islands would still be inaccessible and the adventure would have to be tamed from the thrill of sailing, feeling the roll of the waves and the heel of the vessel as she carried her guests away to a simpler time and a wilder place.

In response to the query about whether there should be limits to the size and capacity of  vessels covered by this docket, unequivocally, YES!  I would recommend the limits currently being observed in the first round of the creation of physical accessibility standards.  Vessels carrying less than 150 day or 49 overnight passengers should be exempted.  This would cover most, if not all, sailing vessels operating under U.S. flag.  S/S 36.21 asks if accommodating some disabilities would fundamentally alter the nature of what we do? Yesso let us use our discretion to carry as many disabilities as possible without jeopardizing the history, the adventure, the untamed nature of what we offer to our guests.  Give us the ability to limit the number of disabled guests we can accommodate (S/S 39.25). S/S 39.33 would allow guests to board without notifying me of any pre-existing conditions that could potentially put at risk all guests and crew.  We dont ask guests for their medical history but surely I need some recourse when I discover I have a suicidal schizophrenic aboard.  S/S 39.61 asks if floating docks need different treatment.  When the tidal range is in excess of 12 feet you bet.  S/S 39.91 discusses service animals (seeing eye dogs) and all the care they require, a situation not feasible abaord a 46 foot schooner?   I could go on section by section but I hope my point is clear.  Small passenger vessels cannot be expected to meet the letter of this NPRM. The intent of any vessel owner and operator is to carry as many passengers as feasible and to comply with the intent of the ADA where possible.  No operator wants to turn away anyone, including a person with a disability.  But the DOT and the ADA must recognize there are feasibility and operational restrictions.  

 
While this DOT NPRM offers the opportunity for waivers upon application, relief from undue burdens, recognizes some disabilities as direct threats to passenger safety, and mentions historic vessels in the context of physical standards, this docket also makes the assumption that these rules will not create significant added burdens and would have very low costs.  In response to the query as to whether there is a need for review of small entity-related issues I believe a thorough review of our operations needs to be conducted by the SBA.  While the DOT does not expect any significant economic impacts I do!  I would be glad to bring representatives of our industry together with DOT and SBA representatives to review this docket and explain in detail the impacts it will have on our industry.  The only DOT financial impact studies I have found record of are over 10 years old and no one in the world of small sailing passenger vessels that I have met has any knowledge of where the DOT came up with it $30,000 estimate.  We could not revamp our dockside facilities, which we do not even own, for that price tag.  Please keep in mind that most of the Maine windjammer fleet operates only 4 months of the year because of navigation limits set by our CG Certificates of Inspection.  That reduces our income generating capacity to one quarter of that of a year round vessel operation that can migrate with the seasons or is permanently based in warmer climates.

In closing I ask that the DOT recognize small sailing passenger vessels for the unique vessels they are.  These are not cruise ships or ferries and cannot be expected to conform to the same rules.  

Respectfully submitted,
Captain Barry King

Owner/Operator, Schooner Mary Day

I would like to voice my support of the DOT approving Dubois County's request to go on Eastern Time.  Employers of a very significant number of our county residents have made known their support for and the necessity of their businesses being on Eastern.  Because companies in the U.S. face so many competitive disadvantages and added expenses versus those of other countries (environmental laws/requirements, higher wages scales, a multitude of taxes, out-of-control litigation, just to name a few), this seems a minimal request to grant to help keep these businesses viable.  We Hoosiers would appreciate your assistance in keeping Indiana economically healthy.

A meeting held by our County Commissioners and countless letters to the editors of area newspapers have also revealed tremendous support of Eastern Time by residents for occupational, personal, recreational and child safety reasons.

		Docket OST-2006-23985

Dear Docket Clerk

These comments are provided to the Docket on behalf of the Western Contra Costa Transit Authority (WCCTA).  WCCTA operates 41 fully accessible fixed route buses and 13 paratransit vans in a largely suburban area just north of Oakland, California.  Our service area is approximately 37 square miles, and we have a population of 65,000.  Our adopted FY06-07 operating budget for WCCTA is $7.8 Million.  Of this, $1.3 Million (approximately 17%) is budgeted for paratransit services, including those required under the ADA.  We have taken great pains to ensure we have no denials of service on our ADA paratransit system, and on many occasions, we have in effect practiced reasonable modifications in our delivery of services to our ADA eligible passengers on both our fixed route and paratransit systems.  We are very proud of our record of ADA compliance and the provision of related services at WCCTA over the past 15 years.

WCCTA has very strong concerns with the proposed amendments to 49 CFR parts 27, 37 and 38.  While we support the concept of full accessibility of public transit, and now provide services beyond those required under the ADA to persons with disabilities, we disagree with both the proposed approach and with the specific details of the regulatory changes contained in the referenced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NPRM.  

We strongly disagree with the representations in the NPRM that the proposed changes are simply a clarification of existing law, and that the proposal does not represent a significant departure from existing regulations and policy and does not have noteworthy cost impacts.  In fact, we believe the proposed regulatory changes exceed the scope of the powers delegated to the Department of Transportation in the ADA statute, and are in conflict with the both the legislative intent of the ADA, and established case law since its passage.  

More importantly, while we believe the Departments motivation in proposing the amendments is well intentioned, we are convinced that actual implementation of the changes will have serious unintended consequences that will diminish the quality, safety and predictability of ADA services for our riders, while significantly increasing costs.  


WCCTA is a signatory to the letter submitted to the Docket by a coalition of public transportation entities agencies throughout the United States.  Rather than attempting to reiterate here the positions presented in that letter (with which we fully concur), we are including the full text of the coalitions comments as an attachment.  We will use the remainder of this letter to provide supplementary comments on issue areas in the NPRM not specifically addressed in the Coalitions letter, or where we have additional concerns beyond those included with the Coalition comments.   

I.	Reasonable Accommodation 

The initial passage of the ADA and its implementing regulations established the legal obligation for each public transit agency to develop, and submit to the FTA detailed plans for ensuring that persons with disabilities had the same right to public transportation as the general public.  FTAs review and approval of these plans provided an understandable and objective measure of the adequacy of each agencys program in meeting the non-discrimination provisions of the law.  For more than 15 years, the FTA-approved plans provided a reasonable and straightforward means of adjudicating and resolving cases alleging civil rights violations.   The de-facto expansion of the standard for ADA compliance (as proposed within the NPRM) based on conditions that will be defined by rider request on a trip-by-trip basis vastly increases public transit operators exposure to litigation, and creates an untenable situation where operators will regularly face tough decisions requiring them to compromise passenger safety to avoid a the civil rights violation.  

In the NPRM discussion of Reasonable Accommodation, it is proposed that a public transit operator, upon request from a disabled passenger, may be required to pick up or drop off that individual at a location other than an established bus stop.  In California, this requirement would place the transit agency in direct conflict with a State Supreme Court decision (Bonanno v. CCCTA) that imposed an expanded duty of care on public transit agencies (indeed, on all public entities) to make sure that a route traveled to its property (in the Bonanno case, a bus stop served, but not owned or controlled by the transit agency) is safe, independent of any dangerous condition at the stop location itself.  In the Bonanno decision, CCCTA was held liable for $1.5 Million in damages, and the basis for this judgment was that the plaintiffs injuries were caused by a dangerous condition she experienced as she tried to access the transit systems services.  

To comply with the expanded scope of California public transit operators duty of care, and to establish boundaries for the attendant liability for any damages sustained by passengers en-route to public transit services, transit agencies must formally evaluate bus stop locations, consider any known incidents or public safety concerns for each location, and have on record formal approval of each bus stop location by the agencys policy board. 

It is simply unworkable for a bus operator to be placed in the situation of having to evaluate and make an ad-hoc decision on a request from a passenger to be dropped off at a location that has not undergone the formal risk assessment outlined above.  The operator may be totally unaware of known hazards or unsafe conditions at the location.  Needless to say, the overriding consideration here has to be the safety of those using our systems. The changes outlined in the NPRM tend to prioritize individual convenience over safety and, in the process, put our passengers at risk.  We urge the Department of Transportation to rescind these provisions in their entirety.

II.	Trip Counting
WCCTA objects to DOTs approach for counting denied trips, which DOT currently follows.  DOT counts each leg of a trip as denied even if the transit authority can accommodate the passengers request on one or more leg if the authority cannot accommodate each leg of the trip.  This interpretation is contrary to the scope and intent of the ADA.  
The ADA requires that disabled passengers have access to comparable public transportation as able-bodied persons.  As the original regulations state, the ADA is not intended to be a comprehensive system of transportation for individuals with disabilities or to meet all of their transportation needs.  Fixed route transportation does not always meet the needs of an individual passenger for every leg of a trip.  For example, a passenger may have to leave his house early in the morning for an appointment so as to make it impractical for a passenger to take public transit on one leg of a trip.  The passenger may take a taxi to his appointment and then take public transportation home.  Likewise, if a disabled person requests a pick up and the transit agency cannot accommodate the passenger within the required one hour window, but the transit agency can accommodate the return trip, DOT should consider the transit authority as denying one leg of the trip and not two.  It is not reasonable to penalize a transit agency for providing transportation for one leg of the journey.  Instead, DOT should judge capacity constraint based on actual denials of a leg of a trip.  This is the only reasonable interpretation under the ADA.

III.	Comment on Other Issues.  Subsection 6, Mobility Devices
The original ADA regulations provided general guidance to public transit operators and to the manufacturers of mobility devices on the maximum dimensions and weight of devices that would routinely be accommodated aboard public transit vehicles.  These regulations offered minimal assistance in the development and deployment of safe and reliable securement systems for common mobility aids, and effectively mandated that public transit systems accommodate any device that did not exceed the maximum physical dimensions and weight defined by the regulation. 
Over the past 15 years, public transit agencies have done their best to safely accommodate a wide variety of mobility devices, including three-wheeled scooters, despite the fact that manufacturers have paid virtually no attention to equipping these devices with hardware to allow them to be secured in a dynamic environment of a moving vehicle.  
The recent guidance DOT provided on Segway devices illustrates the problem we have with the fact that there is still no standard interface between tiedown systems and the mobility devices themselves.  Under the DOT guidance, a passenger could right now be boarding one of our vehicles with a Segway (or conceivably a similar Segway-like device from a different manufacturer), and our driver may be figuring out how to try to secure this device, despite the fact that not one of our drivers has ever dealt with a Segway before.  The device has a higher center of gravity than many more common wheelchairs, and may need to be secured in a completely different way than a standard four point tiedown to prevent it from tipping or moving during vehicle cornering.  A driver encountering the device for the first time will not know if likely anchor points on the Segway will withstand the g-force stresses which may be generated during the trip.  While the driver will make a best guess about whether the device is safely secured, there is no assurance that this is in fact true.  
We believe that the users of our systems would be better served by the DOT exercising its regulatory authority to promulgate a common standard for securement, and to establish a certification process for manufacturers of mobility devices.  Public transit agencies would be only have a legal mandate to transport devices certified to this standard.  This would ensure the safety of the passengers using the devices as well as other passengers transported aboard our vehicles.

We appreciate your considering our comments.

Re:	NPRM:  Docket No. OST-2006-23985, RIN 2105-AD54
	49 C.F.R. Parts 27, 37 and 38, 71 FR No. 38, 9761 et seq.  (Feb. 27, 2006)
	Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities
	
Dear Docket Clerk:

We are a coalition of public transit agencies that provide accessible fixed route transportation and paratransit pursuant to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). We submit these comments in response to the referenced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).  The NPRM proposes to further expand ADA obligations on public transportation providers through amendments to the regulations which implement the ADA, currently codified at 49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and Part 38, and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act, currently codified at 49 C.F.R. Part 27.  These comments are addressed to the proposals to add a reasonable modification requirement to Title II, Subtitle B, of ADA (Title II.B.), particularly with respect to paratransit service, to add a direct threat definition and exception to the proposed reasonable modification rule, and to establish a Disability Law Coordinating Council through a formal rule.  We have joined together in submitting these comments because we are convinced that this NPRMs proposals, if adopted, will have a significant adverse impact on our agencies transportation services.   We also support the comments prepared by the American Public Transportation Association, of which we are members.  Many of us intend to submit separate comments addressing additional issues relevant to our particular circumstances.

We support the concept of accessibility of public transit and voluntarily modify our practices and procedures when it is safe and practical to do so. However, we oppose the NPRM's ""reasonable modification"" rule because it would impose a legal obligation to modify service on passenger demand without regard to passenger safety, potential costs, effects on reliability, operational and administrative complexities and local community needs.  The reasonable modification rule, if adopted as proposed would produce severe adverse impacts on our fixed route transit and paratransit systems, is not redeemed by a proposed direct threat exception, and its promulgation would exceed the scope of the powers delegated to the Department of Transportation (DOT) in the ADA statute.  

           DOT does not explain the purpose of its rulemaking proposal relating to the Disability Law Coordinating Council (DLCC). Further, establishment of such a Council is a wholly internal administrative process that is not subject to the Administrative Procedures Acts rulemaking requirements. Our concern is that the Council not be used to insulate decision makers from the industry they regulate or the constituent agencies of the DOT from the Administrative Procedures Act and SAFETEA-LU obligations when issuing binding obligation pronouncements. 

          We urge DOT to rescind these proposals in their entirety.

A.   THE COALITION 

The coalition submitting this comment consists of ___ transit agencies, identified in the Appendix to these comments.  Together we deliver more than ___ fixed route and more than ___ paratransit rides per year and expend a combined amount of $_______ in doing so. 


B.  COMPLEMENTARY ADA PARATRANSIT AND ITS COSTS

The purpose of Title II.B of the ADA (Public Transportation Provided by Public Entities) was to assure that persons with disabilities would have the same right to public transportation as the general public.  The principal means the statute adopted of assuring transportation access for the disabled was to require that public entities make their fixed route systems accessible to persons with disabilities. 

For those individuals with disabilities who are prevented from using accessible fixed route transportation, public entities were required to create and maintain paratransit at service levels comparable (or in the case of response time, comparable to the extent practicable) to the transit operators fixed route system (42 U.S.C.12143 (a)). 

As DOT noted in the Preamble to its ADA regulations when issued in 1991 (56 FR 45584, 45601):

The ADA is a civil rights statute, not a transportation or social service program statute. .Under the ADA, complementary paratransit is not intended to be a comprehensive system of transportation for individuals with disabilities.  

The Secretary of Transportation explained that it was DOTs intent, in adopting the regulations, to exercise its discretion conservatively, to minimize the addition of costs to public and private entities beyond what the statute itself imposes( 56 FR 45620). 

Despite the Secretarys conservative intent in developing the initial ADA transportation regulations (49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and 38), the annual cost of complementary ADA paratransit in the United States now exceeds $1.9 billion dollars   - a number many times more than the official estimates made at the time the regulations were adopted. This is due to two factors: first, the inherent differences in paratransit and fixed route make paratransit preferable to more disabled riders than had been anticipated by federal estimates (and claims by disability advocates).  Experience shows that many persons with disabilities, given a choice (i.e., able to ride accessible fixed route transit), will elect to ride complementary ADA paratransit despite the fact that it can cost the rider up to four times as much to do so.   Many agencies even offer riders free fare not only for the disabled passenger but also for his or her personal care attendant as an incentive to use fixed route service. Yet, any positive effects of those policies, in terms of reduced paratransit demand, have been negligible at best. The second is that the studies on which the original government estimates were based assumed a substantial denial rate. However, beginning in 1998, DOT through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) began to interpret the ADA as requiring a zero denial rate.

The ADA emphasized the obligation to make fixed route transit accessible to persons with disabilities as the primary method of achieving its accessible transportation goals, not only as a means to give persons with disabilities the most independence in travel and the most integrated mode of transportation, but also to promote the most efficient means of achieving the access goal. Public transit in general is a highly subsidized system utilizing some combination of local, state and federal funding.  The fare revenue does not cover the actual cost of the ride and the difference is funded by taxpayer dollars.  However, on fixed route transit (bus and non-commuter rail), the fare subsidy is far less.  For example, a 10-mile bus ride might cost $2.00, of which the rider pays $1.25, for a subsidized cost of $.75, a 38% subsidy. Moreover, as ridership on the bus system increases, the amount of subsidy needed, all other things being equal, diminishes.  In comparison, paratransit, utilizing ADA-required service parameters, is a highly inefficient means of public transit.  The same 10-mile ride on paratransit will cost $30.00. The rider cannot be charged more than $2.50, thus requiring a subsidy of $27.50, or a 92% subsidy that must be provided by taxpayers.  Thus, for the same ride, the subsidy for paratransit is more than 36 times that of the bus ride. In addition, increased paratransit ridership does not diminish costs per trip but in many circumstances will increase it.  


C.	PROPOSED REGULATION:  REASONABLE MODIFICATION OF POLICIES, PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES
 	
 DOT proposes to amend its ADA and 504 regulations to impose a requirement of reasonable modification of policies, practices and procedures on public transportation under Title II B. It asserts that this is a mere clarification of existing law and that it is supported by prior regulatory interpretations and case law.  It contends that for this reason the proposal does not represent a significant departure from existing regulations and policy and is not expected to have noteworthy cost impacts.  All of these contentions are unsupportable.  If  DOT intends to pursue this proposal, it must comply with the significant rulemaking requirements of Executive Order 12866, and its own Regulatory Policies and Procedures applicable to significant rulemakings, as well as with Executive Order 13132 (Federalism), requiring consultation with state and local governments.  

We demonstrate below that this proposed regulation is contrary to existing case law and 15 years of operating experience. Neither DOT nor FTA had, prior to last year, indicated that transit properties had any transportation obligations beyond those incorporated in the regulations, and, for paratransit, what was incorporated in their FTA-approved paratransit plans.  If adopted, this regulation will have a powerful negative impact on the already-low productivity rate of this inefficient means of public transportation and significantly increase the cost of meeting ADA regulations.  Moreover, as we also show, it is beyond the statutory mandate and therefore if adopted would exceed DOTs authority to promulgate ADA regulations.  

1.    Analysis of the Reasonable Modification Rule and Title II
Shows that the Proposed Rule is Outside the Scope of Title II.B.

 Title II.A precludes public entities from discriminating against persons with disabilities by excluding them by reason of such disability from participating in public services. 42 U.S.C.§12132. Regulations by the Department of Justice (DOJ) (28 C.F.R. Part 35) flesh out what discrimination means in the context of general public services provided by a public entity.  Historically, government programs and activities intended for the general public had been designed without regard to whether those programs and activities were accessible to disabled persons.  DOJ regulations therefore necessarily established a reasonable modification requirement because there are such a wide variety of general public services that developing specific non-discrimination regulations with respect to each of them would be impossible.  However, DOJ regulations, 28 CFR 35.102(b), specifically exempt public transit because it is the one public service singled out for specific statutory treatment in Title II.B (42 U.S.C. §12141 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOT at 49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and 38. DOT regulations as originally promulgated did not have a reasonable modification requirement for public entities and logically so. 

Public transit is the only public service specifically and separately addressed by the ADA (under Title II.B). The goal of Title II.B is to assure equal access to public transit by persons with disabilities.  For those who cannot ride an agencys accessible fixed route service, complementary ADA paratransit comparable to it is required to be offered.
.  
The eligibility, design and the comparable operating parameters for paratransit are specified in the original and detailed DOT regulations.  Fixed route operators designed their paratransit systems accordingly and, as required by the ADA statute and the DOT regulations, submitted a plan as to how this specialized service would be provided (42 U.S.C.§12143(c)(7)).  FTA approved the plan when ...viewed in its entirety it provides for service comparable to the entitys fixed route service and is therefore compliant with the antidiscrimination provisions of 42 U.S.C. §12143 (49 C.F.R. 37.147(d)).

The Departments proposed rule would superimpose on the modifications of the fixed route system imposed by Title II.B, including complementary ADA paratransit, a requirement to further modify in response to rider demand on a case-by-case basis. We believe that this proposal is unnecessary, unworkable and contrary to the intent of the ADA.
	
2.	The Proposed Rule Is Not A Clarification Of an Existing Rule. 

There are no reasonable modification requirements in the original DOT regulations. Further, DOJ regulations that do have such a provision are inapplicable to public transportation (28 CFR 35.102(b)). The only appellate court to directly address the issue determined that reasonable modification was not required for activities covered under Title II.B. Melton v. Dart, 391 F.3d 669 (5th Cir. 2004); cert. denied, 125 S.Ct. 2273 (2005).  Melton involved a plaintiff who sought to compel the paratransit agency to modify its curb-to-curb policy and pick up the plaintiff in an alleyway as opposed to the curb in front of his house. The court determined that the concept of reasonable modification did not apply to paratransit: 

Because paratransit service is meant to act as the disability complement to established fixed route transportation services, this comprehensive regulatory scheme signals that no interim extra-plan modification is statutorily or otherwise required by a public entity when the public entity is properly operating under a FTA-approved plan. The FTA-approved plan is itself the accommodation to the disabled by the public transportation entity. It is the violation of the plan itself that constitutes the prohibited discrimination under title II, not the failure to modify the plan to address particularized complaints (391 F.3d at 675).

In Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania, et. al. v. National Passenger Railroad Corporation (Amtrak), WL 1459338 (E.D.Pa. 2005), 16 A.D. Cases 1596, the setting was fixed route transportation and the court, persuaded by the reasoning in Melton, determined that reasonable modification was not required for matters covered under Title II.B.

  DOTs assertion that Burkhart v. Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority, 112 F.3d 1207 (1997), appeared to share the Departments assumption about the relationship between the DOT and the DOJ requirements (71 Fed. Reg. 9762) is misplaced. As pointed out in Melton, the Burkhart court did not decide whether or not the transit authority was exempt from the DOJ regulations on reasonable modification because that issue had not been raised in the court below (Melton, at  674 n.6; Burkhart, 112 F.3d at 1210 n. 1).


For more than 15 years prior to the issuance in September of 2005 of its unusual guidance regarding origin-to-destination paratransit service DOTs own actions demonstrated that reasonable modification was not a concept applicable to Title II.B.  Since FTA approved our paratransit plans, none of which contained a policy to provide modifications of service on rider request, there has been no indication that anything beyond complying with the paratransit service criteria was required. 

Nor can DOT bolster its argument that reasonable modification is a mere clarification of and existing rule by pointing to  its own unprecedented act of issuing in 2005 its first written guidance on paratransit (interpreting the origin-to-destination requirement), and issued  after this NPRM was drafted.  In that interpretation DOT, for the first time, contended that the origin-to-destination language of the regulations meant that the transit operator had to reasonably modify its service model of curb-to-curb service on request of any rider.  Such an interpretation is contradicted by years of contrary interpretation by FTA officials relied upon by transit agencies.  For example, on June 14, 2003 at the Community Transportation Association of America annual conference in Seattle, Michael Winter, Chief of FTAs Office of Civil Rights, sought to persuade transit operators to address mobility needs of the disabled by providing service beyond that required by ADA. He conceded that the paratransit regulations require no better than curb-to-curb service and that whether to go beyond that and provide door-to-door service for ADA eligible riders is left to local decision-making processes.   This was consistent with other FTA written pronouncements indicating that the origin-to-destination language of 49 C.F.R. §37.129 means that, [t]he exact location of pick-up and drop-off sites are an operational issue not governed by the regulations.   

DOTs view of the requirements of §504 of the Rehabilitation Act has changed as well.. Before the ADA was passed, the author of the current NPRM expressly stated that special accommodations (the equivalent of reasonable modification) for persons with mental, visual or hearing impairments were not required under 504 as interpreted by DOT regulations and concluded that to impose such a requirement would require an amendment to the regulations (52 FR 30803 (DOT Docket 45162) (1987)).  We are unaware of any such amendment ever being made.  

3.     The Proposed Rule is Unnecessary.  
 
Specific regulations already establish requirements for accessible fixed route and paratransit service (49 C.F.R. Parts 37 and 38). These regulations provide the accommodation or reasonable modification of the fixed route transportation (a general public service) for persons with disabilities and have been the basis for the design and operation of accessible fixed route and paratransit systems for more than 15 years.  

On a practical level, the rule is unnecessary because transit agencies do make best efforts to provide modifications requested by their riders.   It is essential, however, for the good and safety of all of the passengers, (as well as to contain the costs of this service, which was intended to be a limited service for a limited group of people), that these decisions remain within the discretion of the accountable parties, the transit operators.  There are no data in the NPRM to indicate that there is a problem needing correction. A few complaints or lawsuits, given the number of paratransit trips given each year
(83,000,000 in 2004 ) and the billions of bus and subway rides annually, suggests overwhelmingly, that riders needs in this regard are being met.  Under these circumstances, it is inexplicable why the DOT would promulgate a regulation on this subject at all, and especially one that imposes a burdensome administrative process not only to make each such determination but also to document compliance.    

4.  The Proposed Rule is Improper. 

The ADA, at 42 U.S.C. §12143(c) (3), authorizes DOT to set forth the levels of service necessary for ADA paratransit systems to be deemed comparable to the applicable fixed route and therefore nondiscriminatory.  Similarly, the ADA, at 42 U.S.C. §§12142, 12147 and 12148 specify the requirements for accessible fixed route transportation vehicles and facilities.  DOTs proposal to superimpose on these requirements a condition that will be defined only by rider request on a trip-by-trip basis exceeds its statutory authority because it fails to define or otherwise exceeds what is comparable to the applicable fixed route.  

The proposed regulation also is procedurally improper because, as previously stated, the DOT has not complied with the conditions imposed by Executive Orders 12866 and 13132. 

5.	As to Complementary ADA Paratransit, the Proposed Rule Makes
 No Sense. 

Complementary ADA paratransit is not a service for the general public that needs to be adapted or modified to meet the special needs of persons with disabilities. It is designed from the ground up as a modification of and alternative to fixed route service to accommodate a subset of persons with disabilities who cannot use accessible fixed route service. There is no rationale for superimposing on the specific regulations regarding eligibility, design and operations of a compliant system the obligation to customize each ride upon request.

	There is no discussion in the NPRM of what consideration, if any, was given to the effect on paratransit riders if the service were no longer to be clearly defined by regulations that are universally applicable and consistent.  Currently, wherever the rider may be when traveling around the country, or even if living in one paratransit jurisdiction while working in another and using both systems on a regular basis, the rider knows what the service must provide.  

By going to a modification-by-demand standard, DOT will force transit agencies to change aspects of service across-the-board when enough riders request the same or similar modification, because the rule as proposed leaves the agencies with no clear basis for denying specific types of requests. This is so because the logistics involved in responding on a person-by-person, day-to-day basis, as suggested by DOT, would have an adverse impact on service reliability, as explained below at C.6, and could add even greater costs and productivity losses than by changing the service across-the-board.  However, this means that in any given jurisdiction, paratransit service is going to mean something different.  When riders need to use more than one paratransit system (not unusual for those working or attending school in metropolitan areas but living in suburban areas, or the reverse), they will not have the certainty of knowing what to expect with regard to each of the service parameters set out in 49 CFR §37.131.  

Moreover, if agencies change the service to attempt to contain the exorbitant costs of this proposed mandate, they will simply have set themselves up for demands by some riders to change the system back to the way it was, on a case-by-case basis, to meet their asserted needs.  

ADA mandated accessible mass transit and mass paratransit, albeit in a necessarily modified way, for the disabled.  DOT, by expanding service requirements enunciated in the original regulations through its 2005 formal interpretations and this proposed rule, will effectively mandate individualized transportation service for each disabled person.  .  , If such a radical departure from ADAs intent is necessary and appropriate, it clearly requires legislative, not regulatory, action.

	
6.  The Proposed Rule Will Add Substantial Uncertainty, Operational Complexity, Costs and Decreased Reliability.

If a transit agency must modify each trip as requested to do so by the rider, it is easy to envision a service in which many or most trips are customized. It is not possible to predict all of the circumstances in which modifications might be sought and therefore accurately forecast its total potential cost. However, DOTs positions on at least three such instances are either discussed in the NPRM or in other Department pronouncements. These are door-to-door paratransit service (71 FR 9763), allowing wheelchair users to ride sideways (November 8, 2005 FTA Letter to Santa Cruz MTD) and the case-by-case abandonment of designated bus stops on fixed route service (71 FR 9764).  In suggesting that these examples are reasonable modifications, DOT makes it clear that it does not consider them to be fundamental alterations of service.  We disagree.

  (a) Modification of Paratransit Service.    The safety and productivity costs of on-demand door-to-door service are well known by transit agencies. For those systems currently using a curb-to-curb service model, these costs include increased dwell time, risk to other passengers and the vehicle when left unattended, and decreased system capacity because of lower efficiency, resulting in increased operating costs and the necessity of renegotiating many millions of dollars in third party provider contracts.  

Dwell time is increased because the driver is helping the rider to the door and returning to the vehicle.  Assuming that an additional four minutes is needed at each end of the trip (pick-up and drop-off) to provide door-to-door service, and that one-half of all rides will eventually request door-to-door service, we estimate that paratransit variable costs will increase by 10.29% (employee compensation and maintenance running costs would actually increase by more than 10%) and fixed costs would increase by 5.44%.  We estimate that just a single requirement to provide door-to-door service on demand will increase the costs of transit agencies currently providing curb-to-curb by at least 8.18%. Given current predominance of curb-to-curb service models, this translates to an estimated nationwide cost in excess of $100,000,000.   

 Despite the extraordinary cost that could be incurred nationally (and for each agency that does not currently offer door-to-door service) by just this one service modification, the proposed regulation would not stop there, but would mandate a host of other customized ride requests, each of which have a similar propensity for escalating the cost and reducing the reliability of a paratransit ride while reducing the capacity of the system.  Moreover, there is no meaningful procedure through which an agency could verify that any modification requests are in fact compelled by the persons disability rather than mere preferences for convenience (of the individual or his/her family).  

The following are examples of other than door-to-door modification requests that this coalitions members have received, and, except for a very few in which riders may not be able to identify a disability-related need, it is readily apparent that a claim can be made that the request is disability-related, whether true or not: 

(1) 	Demands that preclude shared ride or reduce capacity:  

·	Claustrophobia combined with other disabilities
·	Desire to transport bulky packages/equipment as part of tools of the trade of the rider
·	Service animal allergies and phobias
·	Allergies to perfumes, other common chemicals
·	Refusal to ride with others based on race or gender, physical attributes, such as odors, behavior of others, such as use of obscenities, racist remarks
·	Intermediate stops where driver would be required to wait
·	Demand for non-stop ride due to physical debilitation before/after medical treatment (dialysis, chemotherapy, etc.)
·	Ride with wheelchair or scooter facing sideways
·	Space for additional mobility aide to be transported with rider using a different mobility aide
·	Space for cart carrying six oxygen tanks
·	Specific route (smoother roads, less bumpy ride) 
·	Specified vehicle temperature
·	Will not ride with a specific other passenger; must ride with a specific other passenger

(2) 	Demands for Specific Equipment or Seating Location: 

·	Must have van
·	Must have sedan
·	Must have front seat of sedan
·	Must have specific seating location in van or sedan
·	Must have reclining front seat
·	Must have unmarked sedan (stigmatized by name of service on vehicle)
·	Must have mini-van
·	Must have vehicle with less-stiff suspension
·	Must have vehicle with no boarding lights or alarms, because they cause seizures
·	Vehicle too small or enclosed
·	Vehicle must be equipped with outside handles to aid sight-impaired but ambulatory rider to board the vehicle
·	Combined weight of rider and mobility device exceeds 600 lbs.
·	Oversized mobility device	
·	Transport rider with fully-reclined wheelchair
·	Must have two seats due to size
	
(3) 	Demands for specific driver or specific gender of driver: 

·	Fear of minorities due to racial/ethnic bias of rider
·	Fear of molestation 
·	Non-smoking driver (even though driver doesnt smoke on bus, he/she smells of smoke)
·	Drivers with specific second language skills
·	Drivers with security clearances for specific pick-ups/drop-offs in 
security area

(4)  	Demands for unsafe travel: 

·	Refusal to allow mobility device to be secured
·	Refusal of ambulatory passengers to buckle seatbelts or unbuckling them during travel
·	Refusal of passenger who uses wheelchair to buckle seat/shoulder harnesses at wheelchair locations
·	Unsafe pick-up or drop-off points 
·	Drop off at different location than scheduled
·	Driver to leave vehicle unattended and out of sight due to rider need for escort to door or through-door 
·	Refusal to travel with PCA where individual cannot travel alone, requiring extraordinary assistance of driver or resulting in danger to individual, driver or other passengers

(5)	Demands that exceed paratransit service parameters:   

·	Pick-up or drop-off times to accommodate intermodal transportation connection outside hours of paratransit service
·	Cannot arrive not earlier than a certain time outside hours of paratransit service
·	Provide final destination transportation where intermodal transportation connection is missed
·	Provide at-door pick-up which is outside ¾ mile service corridor
·	Rescue trips to pick-up passenger within or outside service hours because persons disability precluded his/her keeping proper track of time and he/she was a no show at scheduled pick-up time
·	Driver to wait excessive periods of time with rider because no caregiver is at the location and rider needs PCA but does not travel with one
·	On-board requests to drop off guest or PCA at different location than riders scheduled destination
·	Paratransit service to provide an escort for a rider
·	Drivers to call rider on telephone upon arrival or as approaching arrival
·	Failure/refusal to pay full paratransit fare
·	Needs more no-show allowances
·	Point of service requests:  add guest, change destination, make intermediate stop, wait for return trip, etc.
·	Day of service request for vehicle with available wheelchair space (or the reverse), that had not been reserved when the trip was reserved (due to changing physical condition, weather)
·	Pick-up/drop-off at door requires carrying passenger using mobility device up or down steps
·	Fixed pick-up or fixed drop-off time(s)
·	At point of service, passenger arrives with a guest for which no reservation had been made 
·	Service available during weekdays but passenger also wants the service on weekends where reduced fixed route service have concomitant reduced paratransit service area
·	Real time request for earlier pick-up because less time was needed than planned and passenger cannot wait for scheduled pick-up
·	Request that vehicle wait beyond established waiting time for passenger to arrive for pick-up

	In short, the effects on paratransit of legally compelled ad hoc service modifications would be to create a system far removed from that complementary with and comparable to the fixed route as envisioned by the ADA.  On a practical level, to require a system that was never designed or intended to meet all of the transportation needs of disabled persons to customize each ride to meet the riders claimed needs would result in substantial reduction in capacity due to increased inefficiency (i.e. fewer passenger miles per vehicle due to increased dwell times and increase in non-shared rides) thereby substantially increasing both operating and capital costs

 (b)          Fixed Route Transportation.  It is patently unacceptable to leave   pick up and drop off locations to individual bus operators discretion based on passenger requests when the decision may result in a civil rights violation. Further, there is an inherent risk of increased vehicle accidents, passenger injuries and deaths, together with the degradation of on-time performance.   . In any event, any individual with a disability who cannot use accessible fixed route service as it is operated by the transit agency is by statutory definition eligible for paratransit (42 U.S.C. §12143(c)(1)(A)(i)); 49 C.F.R. §37.123.  This alone demonstrates that reasonable modifications are not required by current regulations and cannot be required through new regulations.  The statute clearly leaves to transit agency discretion a decision whether to modify its fixed route service beyond ADA requirements to make it available to a larger class of people with disabilities or to provide those persons with paratransit service.

The following are examples of fixed route modification requests that this coalitions members have received and, like the requests on paratransit, a claim can easily be made that these requests are disability-related:

·	Pick-ups/drop-offs at other than designated bus stops
·	Specific bus type to be dispatched because of securement type/location
·	Specific bus type to be dispatched because of lift/ramp types, ride quality or other amenities on the bus.
·	Assistance with packages or luggage on boarding
·	Operator to push wheelchair
·	Operator to assist rider across nearby intersection
·	Operator or crew member to take charge of a service animal during boarding or exiting
·	Operator or crew member to act as a PCA for the rider who needs one but insists on riding without one.

(c)	Administrative Problems.  The Department envisions that the local 
transit agency will make the individual case-by-case determinations as to whether a request for modification  is related to the riders disability and if so involves a direct threat, fundamental alteration or undue burden. If not, the request must be granted.  If the request is denied, there is the further obligation to seek another means of achieving the goal of the requested modification. All this is further subject to the Departments right of review (71 FR 9762-63).  This time-consuming process cannot work in the real world of mass transit. Most requests will occur at the point of reservation or in the field, at the point of travel.  DOTs proposed rule seems to expect public agencies to entrust to their drivers or reservationists the task of making complex decisions that could expose an agency to civil rights violations and tort liability for injuries, deaths and vehicle damage.  Because such determinations will, under the proposed rule, carry potentially significant legal and operational consequences to the transit agency, it is unlikely that any agency would entrust such determinations to anyone below an executive level. Accordingly, responsible implementation of the proposed rule is operationally impractical.  Assume an average paratransit service that books more than 1000 rides per day and assuming only 10% of those request a service modification, an executive of the agency could not possibly have time to consider and rule on the propriety of 100 requests daily or to complete the paperwork to support each denial and devise an alternative as required by the proposed rule.

	Finally, this proposal is likely to result in unreliable service.   A service that changes daily to meet the specialized needs of that particular days constellation of passengers will decrease the reliability of the service.  It simply cannot be expected that drivers can reliably master and keep track of the different services to be made available to each customer.  Consequently, entirely understandable human failures in this regard by the drivers will result in failed pick-ups, or longer dwell times and consequent late drop-offs.
	
7.	The Proposed Direct Threat Exception  Definition Ignores Rider Safety and Will Not, in Any Event, Ameliorate the Defects in this Proposed Rule

DOT proposes to incorporate in Title II.B the same definition of direct threat that exists in Title II.A as a basis (in addition to undue burden and fundamental service alteration) upon which transit agencies can deny a disabled riders service modification request relating to fixed route or paratransit service (71 FR at 9763-64).  However, when the service at issue is transportation, rather than all of the other types of government services afforded under and in accordance with Title II.A, the definition is inappropriate because it does not permit a decision to deny the modification request based on one of the very likely reasons why it should be denied; namely, that if granted it would be a danger to the disabled person making the request.  

By common law, common carriers have an enhanced duty of care to provide safe transportation to their passengers. Nothing in the legislative history of the ADA suggests an intention by Congress to abrogate this duty, especially where it involves the safety of persons with disabilities, a group the statute seeks to specifically benefit.  Under DOTs proposed approach, a transportation agency would be considered to be discriminating against a disabled person by refusing to engage in conduct that was unsafe for that disabled person.  This would certainly be a unique application of civil rights law.  Moreover, nondisabled persons do not have a right to demand and receive unsafe transportation for themselves.  It cannot be seriously argued that ADA created such a right for disabled persons.

Transportation agencies must continue to provide safe passage for their passengers.  If a disabled person believes that a request has been denied on a pretextual basis, then he or she can file a complaint with FTA or litigate directly whether the request was denied for discriminatory reasons, rather than on the basis of safety or other non-discriminatory reasons.  This is in keeping with traditional civil rights law; disabled persons do not need a new ADA regulation to press such a claim.  Under DOTs proposal, the regulation presumes that a denial of a modification request because it would constitute a direct threat to the safety of the disabled person is discriminatory per se.  A transportation agency should not be forced to intentionally engage in conduct known to it to be unsafe for its passengers or face litigation.  This Hobsons Choice is untenable.  

However, even if the safety of the requesting rider were included in the definition of direct threat, its addition to the  undue burden and fundamental service alteration limitations of the proposed rule could not and will not resolve the fundamental flaws in the reasonable modification proposal which we have brought to DOTs attention in these Comments.


D. 	PROPOSED RULE:  DISABILITY LAW COORDINATING COUNCIL 

The DOT does not explain why it seeks to promulgate by regulation an internal administrative process that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) clearly exempts because it is a rule of agency organization, procedure or practice. 5 U.S.C. §553(b)(3)(A). Moreover, DOT states that the Council is in place and functioning effectively (71 FR at 9765).  If a regulation were required, it would have to have been promulgated in advance of the Council issuing binding guidances, thus raising the question whether those issued to date are valid. A stated need to have all of DOTss constituent administrations issue consistent interpretations is an inappropriate goal given that the statutory provisions and regulations for the different transportation modes under the jurisdiction of FRA, FTA and FAA are different.  Proper interpretations would reflect those differences not eliminate them.

While DOT can continue this process with or without a regulation, we do not agree that the Council is functioning effectively with respect to agencies subject to FTA.  To date, the Councils actions seem to be focused on overturning all of the settled expectations concerning the ADA, which had been based, appropriately, on guidance provided over all these years by FTA and FTA-approved paratransit plans.  
Moreover, the process by which prior interpretations are overruled by the Council is poorly designed.  Up to now, there has been no attempt to determine if the complaints received by DOT are true; no survey of how widespread the issue may be; no request made for information from public transit in order to fully understand the issue or the potential ramifications of imposing a new guidance; no survey of riders done to determine whether what the complainant seeks is reasonable (and whether if granted would interfere with other riders service quality).  
Consequently, if the Council is to continue, its legitimacy will depend not on how it was established but by the integrity of its process. Council processes should require sufficient and objective fact-finding and comment from all stakeholders before interpretations are issued, and the Council should limit its pronouncements to reasonable interpretations of promulgated regulations and not attempt to create new rules without rulemaking (such as the origin-to-destination and Segway guidance issued by the Council in September 2005).  
Given no express or apparent necessary basis for the creation of the Council by regulation, we are concerned that its establishment by this process not result in circumventing the APA and the recent amendment to §5334 of the Federal Transit Act in §3032(l) of SAFETEA-LU enacted in August 2005.  Section 3032(1) requires that the rulemaking procedures under the APA be followed before any FTA statement or guidance is issued that imposes a binding obligation on transit properties and those similarly situated.  The purpose is to require transparency and obtain input from all effected parties before these determinations are made. The establishment of the Council by regulation should not be used to insulate DOT or FTA from this requirement.  Because the Council already exists and it is apparently unnecessary to validate it by rulemaking, the proposed rule should be withdrawn. 
For 15 years under the ADA the DOT delegated to FTA the duty to monitor compliance by transit properties with Title II B including the approval of paratransit plans, conducting capacity assessments, engaging in complaint review and providing guidance to transit agencies.  This choice was appropriate as FTA funds many such agencies and has a greater specific experience with respect to the practical aspects of public mass transit delivery. We are concerned that the new regimen of using the interagency Council will, by minimizing the role of the FTA in this process, result in determinations that are ill conceived or impractical to implement.  



E.  	CONCLUSION

	The thrust of our comments should not be misunderstood.  They do not address the propriety of modifications made every day by transit agencies as a matter of voluntary customer service which currently take into account available resources, safety, practicality and service impacts. What is here addressed is the notion that the law should require individualized, customized modifications of rides on a public transit system where the law already defines what is required for such a system not to be discriminatory. To superimpose such a requirement would create a system that is not comparable to the service provided to passengers on fixed route transportation and thus is beyond the mandate of the ADA. Imposition of legally compelled modifications will likely result in a public transit system that provides poorer, not better service to the vast majority of persons with disabilities.

Dear Docket Clerk:
The Local Transit Systems Subcommittee (LTSS), represents over 80 Cities and the Los Angeles County local transit and paratransit providers.  In Los Angeles County over 40 Local Cities provide fixed route services and 80 Cities provide paratransit services.  The Local Cities and the County operators are partners with the LAC Metro in the effort to provide transit services to Los Angeles County constituents.  Our services not only fill the gaps at the local community levels, but we also act as feeders to the Metro and Municipal transit services.  
The Local Cities and Los Angeles County services provide over 4 million trips on the paratransit services and over 10 million trips on the fixed route services to the region.  The majority of the trips are provided to the most transit dependent elderly and disabled members of our community.  The Local Cities existing services currently accommodate special services to meet their needs and we estimate that over 70% of the trips provided are for door to door services.
Our submittal of comments regarding proposed rule changes for CFR Parts 27, 37 and 38 Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities is from a diverse group of operators providing fixed route and dial-a-ride services.  Although we understand the desire to provide better service to customers with disabilities, as operators we must balance that with the realities of limited fiscal and human resources to accomplish new mandates.  Specifically, we must object to:

27.7	Discrimination prohibited

The concept of reasonable modification as presented in the proposed rules is arbitrary and capricious.  What is considered reasonable by one person may be unreasonable to another person.  What constitutes reasonable modifications is not defined meaning actual definitions will be provided through litigation.  FTA accepted service plans will be replaced by unpredictable policy changes resulting in higher costs and reduced service levels.   It should be noted that the provision of complimentary paratransit under the regulations that are currently in place are considered the reasonable modification to fixed-route transit services.

37.129	Origin to destination

Allowing passengers to decide the service level necessary for their trip exposes operators to litigation and less productive service.  For fixed-route operators, bus stops have been sited for safety with spacing being a balance between passenger convenience and speed of the trip.  If a passenger has the right to demand pickup between any stop, safety is compromised as the driver must  constantly watch the sidewalk for flag stops as well as the traffic in front of the bus.  These flag stops may be at unsafe locations since a drivers job description may not include the training and authority to determine for a transit authority where a safe stop is.  For paratransit, the requirement to provide door-to-door service would require the driver to leave his vehicle unattended.  On shared trips, this may require the operator to employ a personal care attendant as an immediate responder to the needs of any passengers still in the vehicle.  The transit providers other option would be to eliminate shared rides incurring significant additional costs.

37.3	Direct threat

Defining direct threat to refer only to people other than the passenger does not take into account medical or psychological conditions that may cause that passenger to be a threat to their own health.  The free fare for personal care attendants (PCA) is an accommodation to this reality.  Prohibiting operators from defining direct threat to include the passenger could force operators to provide PCAs for some passengers at additional cost or place our passengers at unacceptable risk. 

37.15	Interpretations and Guidance

No imperative reason has been presented for codifying a Disability Law Coordinating Council.  The ability of this Council to issue binding rulings without the consent or acknowledgement of the Secretary of Transportation is most troubling for its lack of accountability.  

As local operators, we are currently able to provide a variety of service levels to our riders commensurate with our funding and local needs.  Requiring all operators to provide service under the conditions of the proposed regulation changes will result in significant litigation, and a reduction in service levels due to increased costs.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Dear Docket Clerk:
The City of West Hollywood provides paratransit and local fixed route services that are specifically targeted toward our elderly and disabled community.  Our services not only fill the gaps at the local community level, but we also act as feeders to the Metro and Municipal transit services.  
West Hollywood is a small community of only 1.9 square miles within the Los Angeles County metropolis, with approximately 35,000 residents.  However the City spends over $2 million per year in providing transportation programs, providing nearly 80,000 trips annually.  Funding these programs becomes more challenging each year.  The majority of the trips are provided to the most transit dependent elderly and disabled members of our community.  Our existing services currently accommodate special services to meet their needs in door to door services.
Our submittal of comments regarding proposed rule changes for CFR Parts 27, 37 and 38 Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities reflects the concerns of West Hollywood, as well as concerns from a diverse group of operators providing fixed route and dial-a-ride services.  Although West Hollywood understands the desire to provide better service to customers with disabilities, as a small Local City with limited funding we must balance that with the realities of limited fiscal and human resources to accomplish new mandates.  Specifically, we must object to:

27.7	Discrimination prohibited

The concept of reasonable modification as presented in the proposed rules is arbitrary and capricious.  What is considered 

reasonable by one person may be unreasonable to another person.  What constitutes reasonable modifications is not defined meaning actual definitions will be provided through litigation.  FTA accepted service plans will be replaced by unpredictable policy changes resulting in higher costs and reduced service levels.   It should be noted that the provision of complimentary paratransit under the regulations that are currently in place are considered the reasonable modification to fixed-route transit services.

37.129	Origin to destination

Allowing passengers to decide the service level necessary for their trip exposes operators to litigation and less productive service.  For fixed-route operators, bus stops have been sited for safety with spacing being a balance between passenger convenience and speed of the trip.  If a passenger has the right to demand pickup between any stop, safety is compromised as the driver must  constantly watch the sidewalk for flag stops as well as the traffic in front of the bus.  These flag stops may be at unsafe locations since a drivers job description may not include the training and authority to determine for a transit authority where a safe stop is.  For paratransit, the requirement to provide door-to-door service would require the driver to leave his vehicle unattended.  On shared trips, this may require the operator to employ a personal care attendant as an immediate responder to the needs of any passengers still in the vehicle.  The transit providers other option would be to eliminate shared rides incurring significant additional costs.

37.3	Direct threat

Defining direct threat to refer only to people other than the passenger does not take into account medical or psychological conditions that may cause that passenger to be a threat to their own health.  The free fare for personal care attendants (PCA) is an accommodation to this reality.  Prohibiting operators from defining direct threat to include the passenger could force operators to provide PCAs for some passengers at additional cost or place our passengers at unacceptable risk. 

37.15	Interpretations and Guidance

No imperative reason has been presented for codifying a Disability Law Coordinating Council.  The ability of this Council to issue binding rulings without the consent or acknowledgement of the Secretary of Transportation is most troubling for its lack of accountability.  

As a local operator, West Hollywood is currently able to provide a variety of service levels to our riders commensurate with our funding and local needs.  Requiring all operators to provide service under the conditions of the proposed regulation changes will result in significant litigation, and a reduction in service levels due to increased costs.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,



Joyce L. Rooney, 
Transportation & Transit Operations Supervisor
City of West Hollywood

"139","DOT",FALSE,0,"2005-11-29T23:59:59-05:00",NA,"After considering this proposal for some time I believe that there are two issues that the DOT needs to address in making an affirmative decision on the proposal.  The first is the approval of specific devices by brand and model.  There are already a number of devices, especially in the cpap, autopap and bi-pap field, that have been approved for use by major international airlines, such as Qantas, as well as the FAA.  There is a need for airlines to be provided with lists, continually updated, of approved products. There is also a need for airlines to be required to maintain the updated list, either electronically or in a hard copy format, at each airport gate where they will be boarding passengers.

The other issue I think needs to be addressed is the legal issue.  I have a strong feeling that the legal departments at the airlines have been taking a very conservative approach to devices such as the cpap.  By prohibiting all use they feel they will avoid litigation related to an inability to provide power or having the devices fail.  It may be very helpful for the DOT to provide standardized procedures for use of these devices and, if the airline is in compliance with these procedures, to provide the airline with protection from litigation.  Procedures, such as pre-boarding and testing the power outlet (and providing a different seat if the power outlet does not work) will go a long way in accommodating the needs of both the airlines and the passengers.

MEMORANDUM FOR PRESIDENT=S MANAGEMENT COUNCIL

FROM:		John D. Graham

SUBJECT:		Agency Draft Information Quality Guidelines

The quality of information disseminated to the public by the Federal Government needs to be improved.  

Reflecting this need, Congress recently directed OMB to issue government-wide guidelines that Aprovide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.@  The Administration is committed to vigorous implementation of this information quality law.  

OMB issued government-wide information quality guidelines on September 28 last year.  Each Federal agency is now required to issue its own guidelines that will ensure the quality of information that it disseminates.  These guidelines must include mechanisms to allow the public to seek correction of disseminated information that does not comply with the information quality standards in the OMB or agency guidelines.  To permit public participation and comment, and to facilitate interagency coordination, agencies are expected to make their draft guidelines available for public comment.  

My staff and I have completed a preliminary review of the draft agency guidelines currently available for public comment.  We want to thank you for the substantial effort and careful deliberation reflected in the agency drafts.  Agencies, with highly diverse program responsibilities, disseminate a wide variety of kinds of information to serve many different purposes.  The agency drafts properly reflect this variety.  

Some agencies have developed particularly noteworthy provisions that I would suggest for consideration by other agencies in reviewing and revising their own draft guidance.  I would also like to point out some provisions in agency drafts that do not appear consistent with the text and intent of the OMB guidelines or are otherwise contrary to Administration policy.

Based on our review, I have attached a discussion of important issues, identified noteworthy approaches for consideration, and provided guidance on those provisions that need to be adopted uniformly in all agency guidance.  I request that you send this attachment to the appropriate officials who are responsible for developing your agency=s information quality guidelines. 

We have asked agencies to submit draft final guidelines to us for review by August 1 (which we have extended from an original July 1 deadline).  We encourage you to use this extra time to extend your public comment period.  In light of the recent decision to allow additional time for agencies to extend the period for public comment on agency guidelines (and thus compress the time available for final OMB review), it is my intention to have these OIRA comments considered in conjunction with public comments as agencies shape their final guidelines.

As a related matter, I should note that Mark Forman of OMB is leading work on a content model for presenting information on the web.  It will include guidelines on how to present web content, how agencies should identify web-based material, and general guidelines for what should go on the public internet.

OIRA REVIEW OF 
INFORMATION QUALITY GUIDELINES DRAFTED BY AGENCIES


By October 1, 2002, agencies must publish in the Federal Register a notice that the agency=s final guidelines are available on the Internet.  Agencies must also provide OMB an opportunity to review each agency=s draft final guidelines before they are issued.  Drafts must be submitted to OMB no later than August 1.

The underlying legislation is Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-554; H.R. 5658).   The OMB Information Quality Guidelines can be found in the Federal Register for September 28, 2001 (66 FR 49718), and, as amended, for February 22, 2002 (67 FR 8452).  

This attachment discusses important policy issues raised by the agency drafts, identifies noteworthy approaches for consideration, and provides guidance on those provisions that need to be uniformly adopted in all agency information quality guidelines.  We urge that draft guidelines submitted for OMB review reflect consideration of this guidance as well as the public comments.


I.  SCOPE OF AGENCY GUIDELINES.

In this topic, we discuss a number of constructive approaches agencies used to define the kinds of information that are covered by their guidelines.  In some cases, we refer to provisions from agency drafts.  These examples are quoted at the end of this attachment.

We cite these agency draft provisions as useful constructive approaches.  We caution, however, that these examples are only agency proposals.  Based on public comment and other review, the agencies may further refine these examples.

The OMB definitions of Ainformation@ and Adissemination@ establish the scope of these guidelines.  Both definitions contain exceptions.  Agencies have elaborated upon the definitions of information and dissemination, and the exceptions thereto, to both broaden and narrow their scope.  The specific examples discussed below include modifications that appear reasonable and consistent with the approach OMB takes in its guidelines, as well as suggestions for improvement and greater consistency with the OMB guidelines.  We suggest that agencies consider these approaches for their own use.

Use of Statements of AIntent@ to Define Scope.  Some agencies used statements of intent or purpose to limit the scope of these guidelines.  Such use of Aintent@ clarifies the nature of the inclusion or exclusion in a way to avoid having incidental or inadvertent public disclosure undermine the practical administration of the definition or exclusion.  For example, some agencies insert the concept of Aintent@ into the exemption for intra- or inter-agency use of sharing of information, e.g., exempted is Ainformation ... not disseminated to the public, including documents intended only for inter-agency and intra-agency communications@ (ED, 1 & 4).  On the other hand, some agencies quote this definition as stated in the OMB guidelines literally, and do not insert a concept of intent.  They may wish to include a concept of Aintent@ to avoid inadvertent public disclosure from undermining practical administration of the guidelines.

Exemption for Press Releases.  Some agencies narrowed the exemption in the OMB definition to provide that the agency should already have disseminated the information discussed in the press release in another way.  For example, EPA states AThese guidelines do not apply to press releases, fact sheets, press conferences or similar communications in any medium that announce, support the announcement or give public notice of information EPA has disseminated elsewhere@ (EPA, 15).  This limitation avoids creating an incentive to misuse press releases to circumvent information quality standards.

Exemption for Public Filings.  Some agencies refined the exemption for public filings to permit agencies to Apass through@ information not subject to the guidelines while properly applying the agency and OMB guidelines to third-party information that the agency disseminates.  Agencies need to qualify the public filing exemption to ensure that the agency guidelines continue to apply to third-party information that the agency disseminates, as we discuss below under II, ACoverage of >Third-Party= Information under the Guidelines.@

Exclusion For Agency Employed Scientist, Grantee, or Contractor.  The preamble to the OMB guidelines discusses situations in which the dissemination of information by an agency-employed scientist, grantee, or contractor is not subject to the guidelines, namely those situations in which they Apublish and communicate their research findings in the same manner as their academic colleagues@ and thus do not imply official agency endorsement of their views or findings (67 FR 8453-54, February 22, 2002).  On the other hand, an agency disseminates information Awhere an agency has directed a third-party to disseminate information, or where the agency has the authority to review and approve the information before release@ (67 FR 8454, February 22, 2002).  Agencies that did not explicitly include such an exemption may wish to consider doing so, but need to do so in the carefully balanced ways quoted at the end of this attachment.

Exclusion for Testimony and Other Submissions to Congress.  Some agencies exclude Ainformation presented to Congress (as part of the legislative or oversight processes, e.g., testimony of officials, information or drafting assistance provided to Congress in connection with pending or proposed legislation) that is not simultaneously disseminated to the public@ (Justice, 3; DOT, 9).  As with the exemption for press releases, we think it would be better for agencies to narrow this exemption to provide that the agency should already have disseminated the information discussed in the testimony in another way.  This limitation would avoid creating an incentive to misuse testimony and other submissions to Congress to circumvent information quality standards.

Exemption for Subpoenas or Adjudicative Processes.  The preamble to the OMB guidelines states that AThe exemption from the definition of >dissemination= for >adjudicative processes= is intended to exclude ... the findings and determinations that an agency makes in the course of adjudications involving specific parties.  There are well-established procedural safeguards and rights to address the quality of adjudicatory decisions and to provide persons with an opportunity to contest decisions.  These guidelines do not impose any additional requirements on agencies during adjudicative proceedings and do not provide parties to such adjudicative proceedings any additional rights of challenge or appeal@ (67 FR 8454, February 22, 2002).  Some agencies adapted the OMB exception very carefully.  Other agencies may have broadened this exemption beyond OMB=s intent; they need to limit this exemption carefully to be consistent with OMB=s intent both as to the adjudicative procedures that are included and the scope of the information covered.

Effective Date.  The OMB guidelines establish two somewhat different effective dates (III.4).  An agency=s obligation to conduct a pre-dissemination review of information quality starts only on October 1: AThe agency=s pre-dissemination review, under paragraph III.2, shall apply to information that the agency first disseminates on or after October 1, 2002.@  An agency=s obligation to allow the public to seek the  correction of information that does not comply with the information quality standards in OMB or agency guidelines starts on October 1, 2002, for information that the agency disseminates on or after October 1, 2002, even if the agency first disseminated that information before October 1: AThe agency=s administrative mechanisms, under paragraph III.3, shall apply to information that the agency disseminates on or after October 1, 2002, regardless of when the agency first disseminated the information.@  

Some agencies followed the OMB guidelines carefully in describing when the information quality guidelines will take effect:  AThe DOJ information quality guidelines will become effective on October 1, 2002.  These guidelines will cover information disseminated on or after October 1, 2002, regardless of when the information was first disseminated@ (Justice,  2).   Other agencies need to be careful to track accurately the OMB guidelines in this regard (III.4).

The effective date for the agency=s administrative mechanisms raises the issue of what constitutes agency dissemination of information after October 1, 2002, if the agency first disseminated this information earlier.

DOT defines dissemination after October 1 to exclude archived information that had been disseminated previously.  AAs provided in OMB=s guidelines, these guidelines apply only to information disseminated on or after October 1, 2002.  The fact that an information product that was disseminated by DOT before this date is still maintained by the Department (e.g., in DOT=s files, in publications that DOT continues to distribute on a website) does not make the information subject to these guidelines or to the request for correction process@ (DOT,  23).  This interpretation is consistent with OMB=s intent, and equivalent to the Aarchival records@ exemption.

Still to be considered is how a complainant demonstrates that an agency disseminates information after October 1, 2002, if the agency first disseminated that information before October 1, 2002.  For example, existing official agency data bases, publicly available through agency websites or other means, that serve agency program responsibilities and/or are relied upon by the public as official government data, need to be subject to the Section 515 administrative mechanisms to address public complaints because they are, in effect, constantly being redisseminated.  


II.  COVERAGE OF ATHIRD-PARTY@ INFORMATION UNDER THE GUIDELINES.

The preamble to the OMB guidelines states, AIf an agency, as an institution, disseminates information prepared by an outside party in a manner that reasonably suggests that the agency agrees with the information, this appearance of having the information represent agency views makes agency dissemination of the information subject to these guidelines@ (67 FR 8454, February 22, 2002).  Reinforcing this statement of policy, OMB also provided an example in its preamble concerning the applicability of the OMB and agency information quality standards to third-party studies relied upon by an agency as support for a proposed rulemaking, even if the third-party studies had been published before the agency=s use of them (67 FR 8457, February 22, 2002).

DOT incorporated these principles from the OMB guidelines by stating that an agency disseminates information if it relies on information in support of a rulemaking.   AIf the Department is to rely on technical, scientific, or economic information submitted by, for example, a commenter to a proposed rule, that information would need to meet appropriate standards of objectivity and utility@ (DOT, 3). AThe standards of these guidelines apply not only to information that DOT generates, but also to information that other parties provide to DOT, if the other parties seek to have the Department rely upon or disseminate this information or the Department decides to do so@  (DOT, 8).

EPA explicitly includes a provision embodying the OMB example: AIf a particular distribution of information is not covered by these guidelines, the guidelines may still apply to a subsequent distribution of the information in which EPA adopts, endorses or uses the information to formulate or support a regulation, guidance, or other Agency decision or position@ (EPA, 17).   
Other agencies B particularly those likely to be involved with using and/or disseminating Ainfluential@ information B must include similar provisions in their guidelines.


III.  AGENCY COMMITMENT TO INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS.

In this topic, we discuss (1) ways in which agencies need to commit to information quality standards, and (2) aspects of how those standards should be defined.

Performance Standards.  The OMB guidelines state that, AOverall, agencies shall adopt a basic standard of quality (including objectivity, utility, and integrity) as a performance goal and should take appropriate steps to incorporate information quality criteria into agency information dissemination practices@ (III.1).  The Ainformation quality criteria@ are set forth in the definitions of AQuality,@ AUtility,@ AObjectivity,@ and AIntegrity@ (V.1-4).  Closely related definitions are those for Ainfluential@ information, when used in the phrase Ainfluential scientific, financial, or statistical information,@ and for Areproducibility@ (V.9-10).

Each agency, in structuring its information quality guidelines, must state the agency=s information quality criteria (as defined in the OMB and agency guidelines) as performance goals that the agency seeks to attain.  Each agency needs to adopt explicitly each aspect of each definition of quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity as an agency information quality standard.  Each agency also must explicitly state that it intends to achieve each standard.  Otherwise, there will be no benchmark against which a public complainant will be able to suggest non-attainment. 

The OMB guidelines also state that, AAs a matter of good and effective agency information resources management, agencies shall develop a process for reviewing the quality (including the objectivity, utility, and integrity) of information before it is disseminated@ (III.2).  Given that guideline, many agencies describe in considerable detail the kinds of activities they now undertake to assure information quality.  Regardless, we stress that a mere description of current practices B however good B is not a substitute for explicit performance goals.  At a minimum, each agency must embrace the OMB quality definitions as information quality standards they are seeking to attain.  Examples of constructive agency statements are quoted at the end of this attachment.  

In addition, some agencies and agency components do not appear to have adopted any standards for information quality (utility, objectivity, integrity) and/or defined Ainfluential@ or Areproducibility@ in ways applicable to them.  Each agency must either define its standards in ways applicable to it and consistent with the standards in the OMB guidelines, or explicitly adopt the standards from the OMB guidelines as the agency or component standards.  For an agency that does not anticipate disseminating much information that is defined as Ainfluential@, we suggest that the agency simply adopt the standards from the OMB guidelines as its own.

Core Definition of AObjectivity@.   The OMB definition of  Aobjectivity@ is the most detailed and complex.  This definition has different aspects, some that apply to all information covered by the OMB guidelines, others that apply only to Ainfluential@ information.  

The first issue relates to all covered information.  According to the OMB guidelines, A >Objectivity= has two distinct elements, presentation and substance.  
a.  >Objectivity= includes whether disseminated information is being presented in an accurate, clear, complete and unbiased manner [ -- as well as Awithin a proper context@]. ...
b.   In addition, >objectivity= involves a focus on ensuring accurate, reliable, and unbiased information@ (V.3.). 

Some agencies have summarized this aspect of the definition of Aobjectivity@ accurately.  Other agencies, in summarizing the OMB standard, appear to have left out some of the important standards; those agencies need to summarize the OMB standard accurately.  

Peer Review.  The discussion of peer review in the definition of Aobjectivity@ relates to all covered information.  AIf data and analytic results have been subject to formal, independent, external peer review, the information may generally be presumed to be of acceptable objectivity [if the peer review satisfies >the general criteria for competent and credible peer review= cited in the definition].  However, this presumption is rebuttable based on a persuasive showing by the petitioner in a particular instance@ (V.3.b.i).  

If an agency or component engages in peer review, it needs to discuss the ways in which it will adhere to the OMB standard in its guidelines.  These peer review standards are not limited to information defined as Ainfluential@.  These OMB peer review standards apply to all information covered by these guidelines, and need to be integrated into existing agency peer review standards applicable to covered information.  In addition, agencies must point out B to be consistent with the OMB standard B that the presumption of objectivity afforded to formal, independent, external peer review is rebuttable, although the burden of proof, as explained more fully below, is on the complainant.

AInfluential@ and AReproducibility@.  The next issue relates to agency treatment of influential  information.  AIf an agency is responsible for disseminating influential scientific, financial, or statistical information, agency guidelines shall include a high degree of transparency about data and methods to facilitate the reproducibility of such information by qualified third parties@ (V.3.b.ii; see V.9 for definition of Ainfluential@).

Several agencies provided a carefully considered discussion of the meaning of Ainfluential@ in their drafts.  See provisions quoted at the end of this attachment.

AOriginal and supporting data@ and Aanalytic results@.  With regard to influential information, the OMB guidelines further distinguish between Aoriginal and supporting data@ and Aanalytic results@. 

With regard to original and supporting data related thereto, agency guidelines shall not require that all disseminated data be subjected to a reproducibility requirement.  Agencies may identify, in consultation with the relevant scientific and technical communities, those particular types of data that can practicably be subjected to a reproducibility requirement (V.3.b.ii.A).

With regard to analytic results related thereto, agency guidelines shall generally require sufficient transparency about data and methods that an independent reanalysis could be undertaken by a qualified member of the public. ...   
i. ... Making the data and methods publicly available will assist in determining whether analytic results are reproducible.  However, the objectivity standard does not override other compelling interests such as privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property, and other confidentiality protections.
ii.In situations where public access ... will not occur ..., agencies shall  apply especially rigorous robustness checks to analytic results and document what checks were undertaken.  Agency guidelines shall, in all cases, require a disclosure of the specific data sources ... used and the specific quantitative methods and assumptions ... employed (V.3.b.ii.B). 

In draft agency guidelines, it does not appear that any agency undertook to delineate when Aoriginal and supporting data@ would be subject to a reproducibility requirement.  Presumably, the public comment period is being used to seek views from the relevant scientific and technical communities.  If, at the end of the public comment period, an agency is not prepared to identify what kinds of original and supporting data will be subject to the reproducibility standard, then the agency must include in its guidelines a statement to the effect that the agency shall assure reproducibility for those kinds of original and supporting data according to Acommonly accepted scientific, financial, or statistical standards@ (suggested language).

As to Aanalytic results,@ it appears that a number of agencies anticipate that reproducibility will sometimes not be achievable through public access because of confidentiality protections or other compelling interests.  In such cases, some agencies do not mention the need to Aapply especially rigorous robustness checks.@  Instead, they describe their intent to disclose specific data sources and specific quantitative methods and assumptions. 
In such situations, agencies need to state explicitly their commitment to the standards stated in the OMB guidelines to applying Aespecially rigorous robustness checks@ to analytic results and document what checks were undertaken.  In addition, agency guidelines must, in all cases, explicitly require a disclosure of the specific data sources, quantitative methods, and assumptions used.  We also recommend that agencies, in generating (or contracting to generate) influential information for dissemination, encourage arrangements that will permit appropriate public access to the related original and supporting data and analytic results.

Analysis of Risks to Human Health, Safety and the Environment.  With regard to influential information, the OMB guidelines also state that, AWith regard to analysis of risks to human health, safety and the environment ..., agencies shall either adopt or adapt the quality principles applied by Congress to risk information used and disseminated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(3)(A) & (B))@ (V.3.b.ii.C).
Some agencies discussed these Congressional risk information quality standards; some agencies discussed these in a limited context; and other agencies failed to mention these standards at all.  Those agencies that are likely to use and/or disseminate influential information in their analysis of Arisks to human health, safety, and the environment@ need to clearly state that they are adopting the SDWA standards, or justify in what ways and for what kinds of information the agency is adapting the SDWA standards.  FDA adapts the SDWA standards in a carefully considered, practical way (HHS/FDA, 18-20).  We note that FDA read the SDWA standards as applicable to a risk assessment document made available to the public and did not limit their applicability only to documents related to a rulemaking; that is the proper approach. 


IV.  QUALITY INTEGRAL TO CREATION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.

The OMB guidelines state that AAs a matter of good and effective agency information resources management, agencies shall treat information quality as integral to every step of an agency=s development of information, including creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination.  This process shall enable the agency to substantiate the quality of the information it has disseminated through documentation or other means appropriate to the information@ (III.2).  Consistent with the OMB guidelines, the Small Business Administration explicitly included Ainformation development@, Ainformation acquisition@, and Ainformation maintenance@ within the scope of its information quality guidelines, as quoted at the end of this attachment.

In this light, we note that each agency is already required to demonstrate the Apractical utility@ of a proposed collection of information in its PRA submission, i.e., for draft information collections designed to gather information that the agency plans to disseminate.  Thus, we think it important that each agency should declare in its guidelines that it will demonstrate in its PRA clearance packages that each such draft information collection will result in information that will be collected, maintained, and used in a way consistent with the OMB and agency information quality standards.  It is important that we make use of the PRA clearance process to help improve the quality of information that agencies collect and disseminate.  Thus, OMB will approve only those information collections that are likely to obtain data that will comply with the OMB and agency information quality guidelines.


V.  ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANISM TO ADDRESS PUBLIC COMPLAINTS.

Applicable Standards.  The OMB guidelines state, ATo facilitate public review, agencies shall establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain, where appropriate, timely correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with OMB or agency guidelines@ (III.3).

Some agencies discuss compliance with both the OMB and agency information quality standards in their discussion of the complaint mechanism.  Others discuss compliance only with the agency information quality standards.  To be consistent with the OMB guidelines, each agency should explicitly refer complainants to all of the applicable guidelines B the OMB, department, and departmental component=s guidelines B as the applicable information quality standards.

AAffected Person@.  Some agencies defined Aaffected person@ quite broadly.  For example, AThe term >affected person= means anyone who may benefit or be harmed by the disseminated information.  This includes persons who are seeking to address information about themselves as well as persons who use information@ (OFHEO, 5).  HHS took an even more open approach.  Rather than defining Aaffected person,@ HHS just asks the complainant to Adescribe how the person submitting the complaint is affected by the information error@ (HHS, 13). This invites the complainant to describe how he/she is affected, but specifically avoids any provision that would use this answer to limit or restrict who can point out an error in an agency=s dissemination of information.  

We prefer the HHS approach because it best ensures full public access to the complaint process, a goal of Section 515 and the OMB guidelines.  The focus of the complaint process should be on the merits of the complaint, not on the possible interests or qualifications of the complainant.   Other agencies need to adopt a similar approach.

Decision Criteria and Burden of Proof for Resolving Complaints.  Several agencies state that: ARequesters should be aware that they bear the >burden of proof= with respect to the necessity for correction as well as with respect to the type of correction they seek@ (Justice, 6).  Having the burden of proof on the complainant is consistent with the OMB guidelines and will be helpful in permitting agencies to dismiss frivolous or speculative complaints.  All agencies should make this clear in describing their complaint mechanism to the public.  We quote at the end of this attachment carefully presented statements of the decision criteria and approaches that several agencies plan to follow in resolving complaints. 

Time Periods for Resolving Complaints and Any Appeals.  The OMB guidelines state, AAgencies shall specify appropriate time periods for agency decisions on whether and how to correct the information, and agencies shall notify the affected persons of the corrections made ... The agency shall establish an administrative appeal process to review the agency=s initial decision, and specify appropriate time limits in which to resolve ... requests for reconsideration@ (III.3.i & ii).

Each agency must state in its guidelines the time periods for making decisions on both complaints and also on any appeals.  Exceptions for unusual cases are appropriate.

Some agencies set a time limit within which, after receiving notice of an initial decision, the complainant could file an appeal, generally 30 days.  Setting a time limit for filing appeals appears reasonable.

Some agencies also seek to set time limits for submission of original complaints (in effect, a form of a statute of limitations).  OMB has concerns about the potential unintended effects of such limits and will be reviewing them carefully.  Sometimes agencies continue, long after the agencies= initial dissemination, to adopt, endorse, or use information, and thus, in effect, continue to disseminate it.  Similarly, agencies may continue to maintain ongoing official agency data bases, publicly available through agency websites or other means, that serve agency program responsibilities and/or are relied upon by the public, that are, in effect, constantly being redisseminated.  The damaging effects of poor quality information may not occur or be perceived to have occurred until well after the information was originally disseminated.

An Objective Appeals Mechanism.  The preamble to the OMB guidelines discusses our intent that agencies establish an objective appeals mechanism.  ARecognizing that many agencies already have a process in place to respond to public concerns, it is not necessarily OMB=s intent to require these agencies to establish a new or different process.  Rather, our intent is to ensure that agency guidelines specify an objective administrative appeal process that, upon further complaint by the affected person, reviews an agency=s decision to disagree with the correction request.   An objective process will ensure that the office that originally disseminates the information does not have a responsibility for both the initial response and resolution of a disagreement@ (67 FR 8458, February 22, 2002).

Some agencies discuss how they plan institutionally to structure their complaint and appeal procedures.  Others do not.  We strongly suggest that agencies describe to the public how they plan to resolve any complaints and appeals in order to build public confidence in both the reality and appearance of a neutral, fair decision mechanism.

To enhance transparency, we also suggest that agencies provide the public with timely notice of what information the agency intends to correct after it makes a decision to correct it.  In the annual report to OMB, agencies should also this information as well as a status report on the numbers and kinds of petitions for corrections, appeals, and any denials or grants of petitions for reconsideration or appeals.  Agencies are encouraged, to the extent they practicably can, to give more timely disclosure of this information through, e.g.,  the use of electronic dockets or agency websites, they are encouraged to do so.

We note, in this regard, that a number of agencies emphasize that their guidelines are not intended to provide any right to judicial review.  A few agencies even stress that their guidelines may not be applicable based on unspecified circumstances and that the agency may be free to differ from the guidelines where the agency considers such action appropriate.   

Regardless of what kinds of litigation-oriented disclaimers the agencies may include, agency guidelines should not suggest that agencies are free to disregard their own guidelines.  Therefore, if you believe it is important to make statements that your agency=s guidelines are not intended to provide rights of judicial review, we ask that you not include extraneous assertions that appear to suggest that the OMB and agency information quality standards are not statements of government-wide policy, i.e., government-wide quality standards which an agency is free to ignore based on unspecified circumstances.  In addition, agencies should be aware that their statements regarding judicial enforceability might not be controlling in the event of litigation.


VI.  MELDING THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 515 INTO THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF OTHER STATUTES.
The agencies take a uniform approach to complaints filed concerning information disseminated in the course of conducting a rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (providing public notice to obtain public comment, then issuing the regulation in final form).  The agencies meld the requirement to establish a Section 515 administrative mechanism to address public complaints into the procedures of the APA, NEPA, and other more specific public-comment statutes.  This melding of Section 515 complaint procedures into the structure of existing statutes seems reasonable, and is discussed extremely well by a number of agencies.  Of course, the substantive standards of quality, the information quality standards provided in the OMB and agency guidelines, remain applicable to any such dissemination of information.  Examples of well-reasoned agency statements are quoted at the end of this attachment.  

One of the agency discussions raises an interesting issue: 

Requests for Correction Concerning Information on Which DOJ Has Sought Public Comment. Information on which DOJ has sought public comment includes a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), studies cited in an NPRM, a regulatory evaluation or cost-benefit analysis pertaining to an NPRM, a preliminary environmental impact analysis, a notice of availability, and request for comment on a risk assessment.

DOJ's response to the request for correction will normally be incorporated in the next document it issues in the matter concerning which it had sought comment. The response will be provided in this document rather than in a separate communication.  DOJ may choose to provide an earlier response, if doing so is appropriate, and will not delay the issuance of the final action in the matter (Justice, 6).  

We suggest that Justice (and other agencies) explain in a little more detail the circumstances under which Aan earlier response@ might be Aappropriate@.  We are sensitive to the procedures and long history behind the Administrative Procedure Act.  However, we would suggest that agencies consider adding as criteria for making an early response a demonstration by a complainant of actual harm from the agency=s dissemination of a study relied upon in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or a demonstration by the complainant of substantial uncertainty as to whether the proposed rule will take an unusual length of time to go final.  

Another interesting issue arises when an agency disseminates a particular study in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), i.e., in the context of a particular agency policy decision, and a possible complainant has an interest in the study but not necessarily in the substantive policies embodied in the rulemaking.  The possible complainant may only learn that the agency has disseminated the study by reading the NPRM, possibly after the comment period has expired.  Agencies need to consider how those not directly interested in the rulemaking need to submit and receive consideration of a complaint about the study.  

As a general matter, we urge each agency to carefully articulate the ways in which the APA, NEPA, and other more specific public-comment statutes meld with and thus have the apparent effect of superseding the administrative mechanisms to address public complaints provided by Section 515.  For example, an agency may disseminate a risk assessment prior to publication of an NPRM.  While the agency may anticipate that this risk assessment may be used in support of the NPRM, the agency should still permit complainants to file complaints under Section 515 unless the publication of the NPRM is imminent.  Such a risk assessment may have impacts beyond the scope of the rulemaking.

OIRA REVIEW OF 
AGENCY DRAFT INFORMATION QUALITY GUIDELINES

Additional Quotations of 
Proposed Agency Provisions Organized by Topic 


I.  SCOPE OF AGENCY GUIDELINES.


Use of Statements of AIntent@ to Delimit Scope.  SSA and NSF use Aintent@ to indicate what is covered: e.g., Astatistical or actuarial information prepared for public dissemination; reports, studies and summaries prepared to inform the public@ (SSA, 2 of  2; NSF, 1).  

Justice uses intent to exempt Aprocedural, operational, policy and internal manuals prepared for the management and operations of DOJ that are not primarily intended for public dissemination@ (Justice, 3). 

Exemption for Press Releases.  FDA/HHS exempts press releases Aunless they contain new substantive information not covered by previous information dissemination@ (FDA/HHS, 3).  EPA adds a different qualifier: AThese guidelines do not apply to press releases, fact sheets, press conferences or similar communications in any medium that announce, support the announcement or give public notice of information EPA has disseminated elsewhere@ (EPA, 15). 

State also limits the scope of the press release exemption to apply to distributions of information or other materials that are Adistributed to the press as a summary of a recent event or Department action@ (State, 6).

Exemption for Public Filings.  

Distribution of information in public filings: Public filings include information submitted to EPA by any individual or person. ...  The guidelines do not apply where EPA distributes this information simply to provide the public with quicker and easier access to materials submitted to EPA that are publicly available. This will generally be the case if EPA has not authored the filings, and is not distributing the information in a manner that suggests that EPA endorses or adopts the information, and EPA does not indicate in its distribution that it is using or proposing to use the information to formulate or support a regulation, guidance, or other Agency decision or position (EPA, 16). 

Exclusion For Agency Employed Scientist, Grantee, or Contractor. 

A Component does not initiate the dissemination of information when a Component-employed scientist or Component grantee or contractor publishes and communicates his research findings in the same manner as his academic colleagues, even if the Component retains ownership or other intellectual property rights because the Component paid for the research.  To avoid confusion regarding whether the Component agrees with the information, the researcher should include an appropriate disclaimer ... that the views expressed are his own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Component.  In contrast ..., if the Component has directed a third party to disseminate information or retains the authority to review and approve the information upon release, then the Component has sponsored the dissemination of the information (DOD, 4).  

Distribution of information by federal employees and recipients of grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts: These guidelines do not apply to information distributed by recipients of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements, unless the information is disseminated on EPA=s behalf, as when EPA specifically directs or approves the dissemination. These guidelines do not apply to distribution of any type of research by federal employees and recipients of EPA grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts, where the researcher (not EPA) decides whether and how to communicate and publish the research, does so in the same manner as his or her academic colleagues, and distributes the research in a manner that indicates that the research does not represent EPA=s official position (for example, by including an appropriate disclaimer).  Distribution of research in this manner is not subject to these guidelines even if EPA retains ownership or other intellectual property rights because the Federal government paid for the research (EPA, 15-16).  

Exemption for Subpoenas or Adjudicative Processes. 

FMC explains this exemption succinctly: 
Excluded categories include: ...   Subpoenas or adjudicative processes, including Commission orders, opinions, amicus and other briefs.  Adjudicative processes also include factual allegations by the staff during the investigative and litigation phases of cases brought by the Commission's Bureau of Enforcement.  Because there are well-established procedural safeguards and rights to address the quality of factual allegations and adjudicatory decisions, and to provide persons with an opportunity to contest decisions, these guidelines do not impose any additional requirements on the Commission during adjudicative proceedings and do not provide parties to such adjudicative proceedings any additional rights of challenge or appeal (FMC, 7). 


II.  COVERAGE OF ATHIRD-PARTY@ INFORMATION UNDER THE GUIDELINES.

Agencies included Athird-party@ information under the guidelines in a variety of contexts:

Component dissemination of information prepared by an outside party in a matter that reasonably suggests the Component agrees with the information, renders Component dissemination of the information subject to these guidelines (DOD, 4).

Section III mentions an important concept that may not be immediately obvious to persons reading the OMB guidelines for the first time. As Dr. John Graham, Director [sic: Administrator] of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and others have pointed out in meetings about the information quality guidelines, the standards for data quality that apply directly to Federal agencies also apply, at least indirectly, to outside parties who supply information to the Department. If the Department is to rely on technical, scientific, or economic information submitted by, for example, a commenter to a proposed rule, that information would need to meet appropriate standards of objectivity and utility. Numbers submitted by a commenter as the basis for a regulatory decision B which the Department would necessarily disseminate as part of a rulemaking issuance B should meet data quality standards no less than in the case of information the Department itself generates (DOT, 3). 

The standards of these guidelines apply not only to information that DOT generates, but also to information that other parties provide to DOT, if the other parties seek to have the Department rely upon or disseminate this information or the Department decides to do so (DOT, 8).

EPA disseminates information to the public for purposes of these guidelines when EPA initiates or sponsors the distribution of information to the public. EPA initiates a distribution of information if EPA prepares the information and distributes it to support or represent EPA=s viewpoint, to formulate or support a  regulation, guidance, or other Agency decision or position. EPA initiates a distribution of information if EPA distributes information prepared or submitted by an outside party in a manner that reasonably suggests that EPA endorses or agrees with it, if EPA indicates in its distribution that the information supports or represents EPA=s viewpoint, or if EPA in its distribution proposes to use or uses the information to formulate or support a regulation, guidance, policy, or other Agency decision or position (EPA, 14).

What happens if information is initially not covered by these guidelines, but EPA subsequently disseminates it to the public?  If a particular distribution of information is not covered by these guidelines, the guidelines may still apply to a subsequent distribution of the information in which EPA adopts, endorses or uses the information to formulate or support a regulation, guidance, or other Agency decision or position.   For example, if EPA simply makes a public filing (such as facility data required by regulation) available to the public, these guidelines would not apply to that distribution of information. However, if EPA later includes the data in a background document in support of a rulemaking, these guidelines would apply to that later dissemination of the information in that document (EPA, 17). 


III.  AGENCY COMMITMENT TO INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS.

Performance Standards.  Some agency guidelines adopted performance standards and a commitment to meeting them.  For example,  The Office of Special Counsel clearly states information quality standards as performance goals:

Information should adhere to a basic standard of quality ...  Information should be objective in substance and presentation ...  Information should be responsive to its intended users ...  The integrity of information should be protected (67 FR 21318, April 30, 2002).

Justice draft guidelines adopt the provision from the OMB guidelines relating to performance standards (III.1).

Overall, agencies shall adopt a basic standard of quality (including objectivity, utility, and integrity) and will take appropriate steps to incorporate information quality criteria into agency information dissemination practices ...  A basic standard of quality will be ensured and established for all information prior to its dissemination (Justice 1-2, 3).  

Then the Justice draft sets forth a standard and commits the DOJ components to reaching it:  

DOJ components will ensure disseminated information [meets the standard of objectivity] ... DOJ components will ensure information [meets the standard of integrity] (Justice, 4).

The Small Business Administration combines the approach taken by Justice:

It is SBA=s policy to ensure and maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of the information that it disseminates to the public. SBA will take appropriate steps to incorporate information quality criteria into SBA=s information dissemination practices, and will ensure the quality of information the agency disseminates in accordance with the standards set forth in these Guidelines. SBA is committed to integrating the principle of information quality into every step of SBA=s development of information, including creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination. SBA will comply with all then-existing legal and policy rules, regulations, directives, and guidance at every step of the process (SBA, 4).

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission similarly sets standards and commits to reach them:  

The Commission strives to present information to the public in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner. ...  The Commission also aims to provide information that is accurate, reliable and unbiased (FERC 5, 6).

Core Definition of AObjectivity@.  The following are concise, accurate summaries of the heart of the OMB definition of Aobjectivity@:  

Objectivity involves two distinct elements; presentation and substance: 
(A) Presentation: 
Disseminate information in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner. This involves presenting information within a proper context. 
(B)  Substance: 
Focus on ensuring accurate, reliable, and unbiased information. 
In a scientific, financial, or statistical context, generate the original and supporting data, and develop the analytic results, using sound statistical and research methods (Treasury, 3).  

Objectivity means ensuring that information is accurate, reliable and unbiased and that information is presented in an accurate, clear, complete and unbiased manner (ERS/USDA, 7).   
AObjectivity@ focuses on whether the disseminated information is being presented in an accurate, clear, complete and unbiased manner and as a matter of substance, is accurate, reliable, and unbiased (DOD, 3). 

AInfluential@ and AReproducibility@.  DOT has a carefully considered discussion of influential.  Some highlights are: 

DOT emphasizes that to be influential, information must have a clear and substantial impact. A clear and substantial impact, first of all, is one that the agency is firmly convinced has a high probability of occurring ... In rulemaking, influential information is scientific, financial, or statistical information that can reasonably be regarded outcome determinative with respect to one or more key issues in a significant rulemaking, as that term is defined in Executive Order 12886 ...  In non-rulemaking contexts, DOT will consider two factors B breadth and intensity B in determining whether information is influential ...  DOT organizations should consider whether the information affects a broad range of parties ... DOT organizations will also consider whether the information has an intense impact.  Information that has a low cost or modest impact on affected parties is less likely to be influential than information that can have a very costly or crucial impact.  In considering whether information has a high-intensity impact, DOT organizations will establish and use as a benchmark the $100 million figure used to determine whether a rule is economically significant (DOT,  20-21).  

Justice also has a well-considered definition of influential:  
When information is defined as influential there is an added level of scrutiny afforded this information, to include the need to ensure it is reproducible.  At DOJ, influential information is that which is expected to have a genuinely clear and substantial impact at the national level, on major public and private policy decisions as they relate to federal justice issues.  The accuracy of this information is significant due to the critical nature of these decisions.  A clear and substantial impact, first of all, is one that the agency is firmly convinced has a high probability of occurring.  If it is merely arguable that an impact will occur, or if it is a close judgment call, then the impact is probably not clear and substantial.  To determine that there is a clear and substantial impact, the agency must have greater certainty than would be the case for many ordinary factual determinations.  The impact must be on ""important"" public policy or private sector decisions that are expected to occur. Even if information has a clear and substantial impact, it is not influential if the impact is not on a public or private decision that is important to policy, economic, or other decisions ... The ""influential"" designation is intended to be applied to information sparingly.  DOJ components should not designate information products or types of information as influential on a regular or routine basis.  Nor should DOJ components actually place an ""influential"" label in the title page or text of an information product (Justice,  4).

Both State and DOT, in describing Ainfluential@, emphasize the causal link between the information itself, and the effect it may have on the policy position involved: 

To be considered influential, information must be based on objective and quantifiable data that constitute a principal basis for substantive policy positions adopted by the Department (State, 6).

It should also be noted that the definition applies to Ainformation@ itself, not to decisions that the information may support. Even if a decision or action by DOT is itself very important, a particular piece of information supporting it may or may not be Ainfluential@ (DOT, 21).

Analysis of Risks to Human Health, Safety and the Environment.  FDA adapts the SDWA standards carefully and practically to the kinds of Risk Assessments that FDA conducts. 

Some of the influential information that we disseminate is based on an analysis of the risks to the public of certain actions or exposures to hazardous substances. For purposes of this guidance, we are defining risk as the likelihood that injury or damage is or can be caused by a substance, technology, or activity. We use risk analysis (the integration of risk assessment with risk management and risk communication) as a tool to enhance the scientific basis for all of our regulatory decisions. 

The OMB Guidelines provide special considerations that must be taken into account in certain risk assessments, those that provide the basis for the dissemination of influential information. The Guidelines state that ""With regard to analysis of risks to human health, safety, and the environment maintained or disseminated by the agencies, agencies shall either adopt or adapt the quality principles applied by Congress to risk information used and disseminated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 (SDWA) (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(3)(A) and (B)).@ 

The SDWA risk assessment principles are as follows: 

1. To the degree that the agency action is based on science, the agency shall use 

a.the best available, peer-reviewed science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; 

b.data collected by accepted methods (if reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justify use of the data). 

2. In the dissemination of public information about risks, the agency shall ensure that the presentation of information about risk effects is comprehensive, informative, and understandable. 

3. In a document made available to the public in support of a regulation, the agency shall specify, to the extent practicable 

a.Each population addressed by any estimate of applicable risk effects; 
b.The expected risk or central estimate of risk for the specific populations affected 
c.Each appropriate upper-bound or lower-bound estimate of risk; 
d.Each significant uncertainty identified in the process of the assessment of risk effects and the studies that would assist in resolving the uncertainty; and
e.Peer-reviewed studies known to the agency that support, are directly relevant to, or fail to support any estimate of risk effects and the methodology used to reconcile the inconsistencies in the scientific data.

Many of our actions are based on scientific experts' judgments using available data, are essentially qualitative, and are generally carried out for non-cancer-causing hazards. Such assessments provide useful answers in most instances that are sufficient for regulatory purposes, and much more elaborate, quantitative estimates extrapolating beyond the data are unnecessary. For example, we may issue regulations on submission requirements for product approval applications, electronic submission of product labeling, or periodic reporting by manufacturers of adverse events from drugs; devices; and biologics, including blood, vaccines, and tissues. Although we analyze the economic costs of the regulations and consider alternatives, regulations like these do not lend themselves to the types of quantitative risk assessments contemplated by the Safe Drinking Water Act principles. 
Other actions are based on research and supporting data that are generated outside FDA. For example, most product approval actions are based on scientific studies conducted by sponsors seeking marketing approval in accordance with our regulations and guidance documents. Our regulations and guidance documents describe sound scientific practices for conducting human and animal studies of medical products and analyzing the resulting data. Most information in these studies is considered confidential commercial information and is closely held by the sponsors. As a result, formal peer-review of the data is rare. However, for certain drug approval applications, the safety and/or effectiveness information is presented to scientific advisory committees for recommendations. Evaluations of food safety and nutritional data are also presented to scientific advisory committees. 

As a result, we have adapted the general principles for risk assessments from the SDWA to fit these situations. The principles we intend to apply to risk assessments involving the dissemination of influential information affecting product approval actions or regulations that do not lend themselves to quantitative risk assessment are as follows: 

1. The Agency will use 

a.the best available science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices, including peer reviewed studies when available; and 
b.data collected by accepted methods (if reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justify use of the data). 

2. In the dissemination of public information about risks, the Agency will ensure that the presentation of information about risk effects is comprehensive, informative, and understandable. 

In situations requiring a quantitative risk assessment, we generally follow basic risk assessment principles in the NAS paradigm of 1983. Our needs for quantitative risk assessments range over a wide variety of hazards including physical hazards encountered during use of a medical device, food chemical residues, and antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria. Thus, we also ascribe to the statement from NAS when it revisited the risk assessment process in 1994 (Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment, NAS 1994): ""Risk assessment is not a single process, but a systematic approach to organizing and analyzing scientific knowledge and information.""  In each of the areas we regulate, we apply risk assessment practices to the specific task that are widely accepted among relevant domestic and international public health agencies. 

For quantitative risk assessments in support of the dissemination of influential information, FDA intends to apply the following principles: 

1. The agency will use- 

a.the best available science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; 

b.data collected by accepted methods (if reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justifies use of the data). 

2. In the dissemination of public information about health risks, the agency shall ensure that the presentation of information is comprehensive, informative, and understandable, within the context of its intended purpose. 

3. In a risk assessment document made available to the public, the agency shall specify, to the extent practicable- 

a.Each population addressed by any estimate of applicable effects; 
b.The expected or central estimate of risk for the specific populations affected; 
c.Each appropriate upper-bound and/or lower-bound risk estimate; 
d.Data gaps and other significant uncertainties identified in the process of the risk assessment and the studies that would assist in reducing the data gaps; and 
e.Additional studies not used to produce the risk estimate that support or fail to support the findings of the assessment and the rationale of why they were not used (HHS/FDA, 18-20).


IV.  QUALITY INTEGRAL TO CREATION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.

Labor and USDA state the general principle extremely clearly: 

The quality assurance process should begin at the inception of the product development process (Labor, 5).

USDA agencies and offices will review the quality (including the objectivity, utility, and integrity) of information before it is disseminated and treat information quality as integral to every step of their development of information, including creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination (USDA, 3). 

The Small Business Administration explicitly included Ainformation development@, Ainformation acquisition@, and Ainformation maintenance@ within the scope of its information quality guidelines:

When SBA develops information, it will use its enterprise architecture as a guide in building the groundwork for the information. This enterprise architecture will help define the goals for the information, information sharing requirements, original and supporting data needs, and all the applications for the information, among other things. SBA will determine and document all requirements for the information (SBA, 4).

At the information acquisition stage, SBA will remain cognizant of potential problems with information quality, including accuracy, currency, and completeness. Wherever possible during the information acquisition process, SBA will verify (assess completeness, accuracy, consistency, currency, timeliness) and validate (assess whether the data are appropriate for the measures it was collected to show) the data it collects, and scrub such data to correct problems.  SBA will use lessons learned from this process to improve its information acquisition procedures. SBA also will document limitations on data and other information as a result of problems discovered during the information acquisition stage that SBA could not correct before it disseminates the information (SBA, 4).

SBA will make every effort, within SBA=s available resources, to improve the information it maintains, including its data systems or processes. SBA will encourage feedback from both internal and external sources on the quality of SBA=s information, and will consider making changes to its information development and acquisition procedures to correct errors and other problems. SBA will conduct information quality assessments, including reviews and inspections of data, comparisons with other sources of similar data, and verification and validation of information and data. SBA also will take steps to ensure that the information SBA maintains remains secure from unauthorized access, revision, falsification, or corruption (SBA, 5).


V.  ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANISM TO ADDRESS PUBLIC COMPLAINTS.

Applicable Standards.  It is important that the administrative mechanism to address public complaints point out that agency failure to comply with either the OMB or the agency information quality standards can serve as a basis for complaint.  For example, AERS  has developed administrative mechanisms to allow affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information disseminated ... that does not comply with OMB, USDA, or ERS Information Quality Guidelines@ (ERS/USDA, 14).   By citing the OMB, department, and departmental component=s guidelines, ERS assures compliance with all of the applicable guidelines and this provision in its guidelines is consistent with the OMB guidelines. 

AAffected Persons@.  HHS and its components ask the complainant to Adescribe how the person submitting the complaint is affected by the information error@ (HHS, 13).  SEC invites the complainant to identify the perceived affect B Aan explanation of how the requestor is an affected person with regard to those facts or data@ (SEC, 7).  

SSA and FERC prevent the word Aaffected@ from having any limiting effect by not using it.  SSA and FERC make no mention of affected persons in their complaint procedures, and do not require the complainant to explain how he is affected (see, SSA, 1; FERC, 8).

Information Provided to the Agency.  HHS encourages complainants to provide needed detail. ARequests for correction that are specific and provide evidence to support the need for correction will enable the agency to provide a satisfactory response@ (HHS, 12). 

DOT takes the same approach: 

DOT may be unable to process, in a timely fashion or at all, requests that omit one or more of the requested elements. DOT will attempt to contact and work with requesters to obtain additional information when warranted (DOT, 15).

Decision Criteria and Burden of Proof for Resolving Complaints.   In the preamble to the OMB guidelines, OMB emphasized the discretion agencies had in deciding how to resolve complaints.

Overall, OMB does not envision administrative mechanisms that would burden agencies with frivolous claims.  Instead, the correction process should serve to address the genuine and valid needs of the agency and its constituents without disrupting agency processes.  Agencies, in making their determination of whether or not to correct information, may reject claims made in bad faith or without justification, and are required to undertake only the degree of correction that they conclude is appropriate for the nature and timeliness of the information involved, and explain such practices in their annual fiscal year reports to OMB (66 FR 49721, September 28, 2001).

Justice emphasizes the limits of its obligation:

After it has completed its review, DOJ will determine whether a correction is warranted, and, if so, what corrective action it will take.  Any corrective action will be determined by the nature and timeliness of the information involved and such factors as the significance of the error on the use of the information, the magnitude of the error, and the cost of undertaking a correction. DOJ is not required to change, or in any way alter, the content or status of information simply based on the receipt of a request for correction.  The Department need not respond substantively to frivolous or repetitive requests for correction.  Nor does the Department have to respond substantively to requests that concern information not covered by the guidelines or from a person whom the information does not affect (Justice, 6). 

State articulates the many different ways in which it may respond: 

Subject to applicable law, rules and regulations, corrective measures may include, without limitation, personal contacts via letter or telephone, form letters, press releases or postings on the Department website to correct a widely disseminated error or address a frequently raised request. Corrective measures, where appropriate, should be designed to provide reasonable notice to affected persons of any corrections made (State, 5).

Labor stresses practical constraints in correcting errors:

Any structured process would not apply to an agency=s archival information or to public filings. Agencies may choose not to respond to complaints about claimed defects that are frivolous or unlikely to have substantial future impact. It may not be in the public interest for agencies to devote significant resources to correcting information where the expenditure of such resources is not, in the agency=s view, cost effective in light of the significance of the asserted error, the benefits that are likely to be derived from such a correction, the costs of the correction, and the agency=s more pressing priorities and obligations (Labor, 7).

DOT includes economic concerns in its criteria for deciding what and how much to correct: 

The costs and benefits of using a higher quality standard or a more extensive review process will be considered in deciding the appropriate level of review and documentation (DOT,13).  When the DOT organization determines that a correction of the information is warranted, revisions/corrections to the information in question will begin as quickly as practicable. However, the Department=s budget, resources, and priorities, as well as the complexity of the correction task itself, may result in DOT actually taking this corrective action within a reasonable time after the Department has made the determination that a correction is appropriate (DOT, 18).

DOT plans to make both the complaint and subsequent DOT responses available on the web: 

In the administrative correction process, DOT will make extensive use of the internet accessible DMS. All requests for correction would come, in the first instance, to the DMS, whether electronically or in hard copy. By docketing requests for correction and subsequent DOT responses in the DMS, the Department will ensure the transparency of the request and response process. The DMS will also electronically notify DOT organizations of pending requests. In addition, filing requests with DMS will allow other interested parties to comment about or make requests with respect to an information issue. For example, suppose DOT publishes a study indicating that 75 percent of a certain kind of accident is caused by a component of a motor vehicle. Manufacturers of that component request correction of the study. Alerted to the request by the DMS posting, vehicle manufacturers could respond within 30 days. The Department seeks comment on this process (DOT, 3).

Time Periods for Resolving Complaints and Any Appeals and Notice to the Public.  

EPA takes an indirect approach to setting time limits on the filing of any complaints.  EPA exempts what it calls outdated or superseded information from being covered by the EPA guidelines: 

The guidelines do not apply to outdated or superseded EPA information that is provided as background information but no longer reflects EPA policy or influences EPA decisions, where EPA indicates (in a disclaimer or otherwise) that the materials are provided as background materials and do not represent EPA=s current view (EPA, 15).

An Objective Appeals Mechanism.  HHS requires that Athe agency official who handles the original complaint will not have responsibility for resolving the appeal@ (HHS, 13).  

Labor requires that: 
The agency should generally provide that the official conducting the second level review is not the same official that responded to the initial request or from the same office that prepared the information in question. Designated agency officials may consult with other agency or Departmental offices, as the agency may deem appropriate to the resolution of the complaint (Labor, 6).

When Interior agrees with an appeal, it also takes steps to notify the public of its decision by withdrawing the information from the public domain.

If at the end of the 45-day period, the bureau or office determines that the complaint is without merit, the complainant will be so notified.  If at the end of the 45-day period, the bureau or office determines that the complaint has merit, it shall so notify the complainant, the appropriate program or office, and it shall take reasonable steps to withdraw the information from the public domain and from any decision making process in which it is being used.  If the bureau or office determines that it will correct challenged information, it will notify the complainant of its intent and the corrective steps it proposes.  The bureau or office may determine the schedule and procedure for correcting the challenged information, but may not disseminate the challenged information in any form until it has been corrected.  Upon redisseminating corrected information, the bureau or office will provide the complainant with a copy of the corrected information (Interior, 2-3).


VI.  MELDING THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 515 INTO THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF OTHER STATUTES.

Treasury stated its position succinctly: 

Certain disseminations of information include a comprehensive public comment process (e.g., notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), regulatory analyses, and requests for comment on an information collection subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act). The administrative complaint mechanism described in these guidelines does not apply to such documents. Persons questioning information disseminated in such a document must submit comments as directed in that document. An additional complaint and appeal process for information that is already subject to a public comment process is inappropriate and unfair to other public commenters who submitted timely comments (Treasury, 6-7; Commerce took a similar approach, Commerce, 11).

DOT discusses this issue thoroughly:  

[T]here are some circumstances in which there is an existing process to respond to concerns expressed about the DOT=s information. The OMB guidelines encourage agencies to make use of existing processes in a flexible way, tailored to their programs. When there is a sound existing process, (such as a process that provides opportunities for public participation in making an agency decision), DOT organizations are asked not to duplicate that process with a separate request response mechanism.  For example, when an agency issues a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), it typically describes in the preamble the basis for its proposed regulatory provisions, which may include technical or scientific studies and a regulatory evaluation. In so doing, it disseminates these studies or evaluations, within the meaning of these guidelines. The public comment process can, and often does, generate views from interested persons about the soundness of the underlying information. If someone submits a request for correction pertaining to a document cited in an NPRM, DOT would treat it procedurally like a comment to the rulemaking, responding to it in the preamble of the final rule or a subsequent document such as a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM), rather than through the separate request response mechanism of these guidelines. The content of the response would address the issues of the document=s compliance with the information quality principles of the OMB and DOT guidelines. (DOT could choose to make an earlier correction, if warranted, assuming so doing would not delay the issuance of the final rule.) This approach would also apply to other processes involving a structured opportunity for public participation on a proposed document before a final document is issued, such as a draft environmental impact statement (EIS), an air quality conformity determination, or a Section 4(f) determination under the Department of Transportation Act ...

On the other hand, with respect to new information appearing for the first time in a final rule or EIS, DOT would consider a request for correction. The Department would not stay the final action involved. However, if it appeared that the information that was the subject of the request did not comply with the guidelines, and that, as a result, the final document was materially flawed, DOT would treat the matter as a request for reconsideration. In such cases, the Department would use any already existing mechanisms and procedures to reconsider corrections, such as the process to petition for a new rule or to request a Supplemental EIS. The submission of a request for correction by itself does not in any way affect the finality of a decision of the Department. 

We believe that this approach serves the purposes of the guidelines, affords an opportunity for correction of any material that does not comply with the guidelines, yet does not duplicate effort or interfere with the orderly progress of DOT=s work. We seek comment on this approach (DOT, 4-5).

This section concerns requests for correction concerning information on which a DOT organization has sought public comment (e.g., a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), studies cited in an NPRM, a regulatory evaluation or cost-benefit analysis pertaining to the NPRM; a draft environmental impact statement; a proposed policy notice or aviation order on which comment has been sought; a request for comments on an information collection subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act).

The DOT organization=s response to the request for correction will normally be incorporated in the next document it issues in the matter concerning which it had sought comment (e.g., in the case of an NPRM, the preamble to the final rule), DOT may choose to provide an earlier response, if doing so is appropriate and will not delay the issuance of the final action in the matter. Once again, the DOT organization will place their response in the DMS. As stated above ... , a DOT organization may reject a request for correction with respect to information in a final document if there was an opportunity for public comment or participation and interested persons could have requested the correction of the information at the proposed stage (DOT, 18).

If there is an existing process for reconsidering a particular sort of information disseminated by DOT, the DOT organization will make use of that process. For example, if the information relates to a final rule a DOT organization has issued, and the DOT organization has an existing process for handling requests for the reconsideration of a final rule, the DOT organization would use that process. If the information relates to a final EIS, the DOT organization may handle the request as though it were a request for a Supplemental EIS (DOT, 19).
 
Labor included this discussion with its public notice of the complaint mechanism: 

This process is not intended to substitute for other legally authorized processes, such as the Privacy Act or the rulemaking processes.  Concerns regarding information in a rulemaking must be presented in the rulemaking in accordance with the rulemaking=s procedures. ...  In deciding how to handle complaints, agencies should be especially mindful of their legal obligations, program priorities, resource constraints, and their duty to use resources efficiently. For example, agencies have important responsibilities to issue rules and provide compliance guidance to the public. Agencies must administer the complaint and appeal process consistent with these obligations and their responsibilities to carry them out in an expeditious manner (Labor,  6-7). 

DOT will reject a request for correction of information that could have been raised at the proposed rule stage:

With respect to information in a final rule, final environmental impact statement, or other final document on which there was an opportunity for public comment or participation, could interested persons have requested the correction of the information at the proposed stage?  If the DOT organization determines that the answer to [this] Question ... is Ayes,@ DOT will reject your request (DOT, 17).
